            "['The rising prices of steel -- which is widely used in sectors like construction, auto, consumer goods, etc -- will not affect the demand in the domestic market,CEO and Managing Director T V Narendran has said.He also said that the current prices of steel in India are higher if compared with rates prevailed a few months back but the same are lower in comparison to the rates in the international markets.\"Yes, prices are higher compared to what they were in the past but lower compared to anywhere in the world. I don\\'t think it should affect demand,\" he told PTI. Narendran made the statement while replying to a question whether surging prices of steel will affect the immediate demand for steel by the Indian consumers.The CEO further said if one takes a look at the prices of hot rolled coil in the US, it is at USD 1,500/ tonne, in Europe it\\'s close to 1,000 euros per tonne. \"So, I think the steel users in India have the best available prices in the world.\"The exporters of steel-intensive products are in a good position as the prices in India give them a chance to be competitive in the global market, he said.In India, steel is trading at an all-time high. In May 2021, the steel makers raised prices of Hot Rolled Coil (HRC) by Rs 4,000 to Rs 67,000 per tonne and Cold Rolled Coil (CRC) by Rs 4,500 to Rs 80,000 per tonne.HRC and CRC are flat steel used in steel-consuming industries such as auto, appliances and construction.The prices of vehicles, consumer goods, and construction cost are bound to be impacted by the rise in steel prices as steel is a raw material for these sectors, an expert said.Meanwhile, last week on Wednesday, country\\'s largest iron ore mineralso hiked the prices of lump ore by Rs 700 to Rs 7,650 a tonne per tonne, and fines by Rs 1,500 to Rs 6,560 per tonne.Iron ore is a key raw material used in steel making. Any change in its prices has a direct impact on the rates of steel.', '(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer prices climbed in April by the most since 2009, amid a record increase in used-car costs and signaling a build-up in inflationary pressures as burgeoning demand gives companies latitude to pass on higher costs. The consumer price index increased from the prior month after a 0.6% gain in March, according to Labor Department data Wednesday. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core CPI rose from March. The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.2% in the CPI and a 0.3% gain in the core measure. The annual CPI figure surged to , distorted by the comparison to the pandemic-depressed index in April 2020. This phenomenon -- known as the base effect -- will skew the May figure as well, likely muddling the ongoing inflation debate. While Federal Reserve officials and economists acknowledge the temporary boost, its unclear whether a more durable pickup in inflationary pressures is underway against a backdrop of soaring commodities costs, trillions of dollars in government economic stimulus and incipient signs of higher labor costs. The core CPI measure, which was also biased higher by the base effect, rose from 12 months ago. For the last year the annual core inflation metric has held below 2%. Wednesdays report offers insight into bubbling price pressures across parts of the economy. Wages have shown signs of picking up, and supply chain challenges have elongated delivery times and driven materials prices higher. (c)2021 Bloomberg L.P.', '(Bloomberg) -- After several years weighing the pros and cons of leaving Hong Kong, Ms Lee is taking the plunge and moving to Canada. Though she has no job lined up, faces higher taxes and will have to endure harsh winters for the first time, shes willing to risk it. \"Am I worried about my job prospects in Canada? Of course Im worried,\" said the compliance officer at a major global financial firm who asked that her first name not be used. \"The economy isnt great and firms are freezing headcount. I can say this is probably the worst time to migrate.\" As China strengthens its hold on Hong Kong with a new security law, residents considering an escape are coming to grips with the sacrifices theyll face. With the global economy enmeshed in the worst recession in almost a century, jobs are hard to find and countries are tightening borders. Hard-earned skills, languages and contacts that helped them thrive in the Asian finance hub wont all travel. And preferred destinations like Canada, Australia and the U.K. impose taxes that are three times higher. \"Just because you were successful in Hong Kong doing a certain job doesnt mean that theres going to be an appetite for your skill set or experience in another country,\" said John Mullally, regional director at Robert Walters Plc, who handles financial sector recruitment for Southern (NYSE: ) China and Hong Kong. \"Its probably one of the worst times in our living history to be rocking up in a new country and expecting to land a job.\" The challenges arent deterring people like Lee. Shes already bought a house in Toronto and plans to move in October, foregoing a job paying more than HK$1 million ($130,000) a year. Lee, in her 30s, and her husband first applied for a visa in 2014 as a back-up plan in case things got worse. In her view it has, with the security law becoming the last straw. Lost Optimism \"We have lost any optimism toward the Hong Kong government,\" she said, convinced that the finance hub will become just another Chinese city with curbs on free speech and censored television. \"We dont want to stay here any longer.\" Even with the risks that come with relocation -- especially in the middle of a global pandemic -- recruiters are seeing an uptick in demand. Two years ago, about 80% of job hunters who came to see Mullally were looking for work in Hong Kong. Now about half of them are seeking work abroad, driven by the security measures along with dwindling job prospects in a city embroiled in a deep recession of its own. \"The message they gave me is they just dont feel that Hong Kong for them is long-term the best option from a career and earnings perspective,\" Mullally said. Yet with unemployment rate in Canada at double digits and Australia close to that, emigres like Sam recognize the job search wont be easy. The senior investment banker at a global firm is moving with his wife and two kids to Australia in three months. Sam spent his teens in Australia, but has been in Hong Kong for 20 years, developing contacts that launched his banking career. He declined to reveal his salary, though investment bankers in Hong Kong are typically awarded bonuses that are 50% higher than in Sydney, Mullally said. Senior private bankers meanwhile earn about 30% more in Hong Kong than in Australia, said Rick Chung, a Hong Kong-based recruiter for banking and finance at Randstad NV who is seeing about 10 to 15 finance people a week looking for jobs abroad. Sam, 43, will have to start from scratch in Australia, and may have to switch careers. With the top marginal income tax rate of about 45% -- versus 15% in Hong Kong -- hell also have less money to spend. \"I left Australia many, many years ago and I dont have any corporate contacts there so itd be hard for me to stay in investment banking,\" said Sam, who didnt want his last name published. \"Taxes are so much higher in Australia so I dont think I will be able to earn as much.\" A mid-level mergers and acquisitions banker named Leung is also considering a move -- to London. Leung, 38, worked there for five years before coming back to Hong Kong a decade ago. Like Sam, hes looking for a better place to raise his three-year-old son. Leung doesnt hold U.K. citizenship but has a British National Overseas passport granted to Hong Kong residents before the colony was handed back to China in 1997. Leung has no job lined up in London, where bankers typically earn about 15% more than in Hong Kong, but also pay triple the taxes. While housing in Hong Kong is among the most expensive in the world, London isnt far behind. \"I dont mind giving up what we have in Hong Kong to trade for a better future for my son,\" said Leung, adding the hardest part will be leaving his parents behind. \"I dont mind starting all over again.\" Staying Put Another investment banker at a U.S. firm named Tang spent his teen years in Canada and has a passport allowing him to eventually retire there. For now, the 50-year-old prefers to stay put with his three kids for another few years. \"I have to say Hong Kong is still the financial center where bankers make the most take-home salary,\" Tang said. Lee meanwhile, is getting ready to head to Toronto in a few weeks, after winning a bidding war to buy a house in the citys west end. Many friends may follow suit she says, while another colleague at her firm just quit to decamp to the U.K. \"So many around me are plotting to leave Hong Kong,\" she said. \"Honestly, who isnt?\" (c)2020 Bloomberg L.P.', 'Despite impact of second wave of COVID-19, the company has guided for 13-15 percent revenue growth in FY22 as it thinks the present crisis is short term and its impact would be lesser Bharat Gianani Jitendra Kumar Gupta', 'By Christiana Sciaudone Investing.com --At Home Group Inc (NYSE: ) rose more than 3% after its largest shareholder revealed plans to oppose a deal to take the company private because the price is too low, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing a copy of a letter to the board of directors.

ICEA foeacasts that the total market for Li-ion batteries in India is set to reach 135 GWh by 2025. Of this 100 GWh will cater to EVs and solar products alone while mobile phones and power banks will consume another 18 GWh.As per the governments announcement, ACC battery storage manufacturers will be selected through a transparent competitive bidding process. The manufacturing facility would have to be commissioned within two years.

We would recommend booking the gains in Happiest Minds and adding the stock on decline in a volatile market.', '(Bloomberg) -- Rising cases of the India variant of coronavirus could force the U.K. government to delay plans to end the pandemic lockdown, officials fear. The number of confirmed infections of the strain more than doubled in the past week to 1,313 from 520, according to Public Health England. While theres no evidence the India variant can evade vaccines, there are signs that it spreads more easily than the Kent mutation which ran rampant in the U.K. at the start of the year, prompting a third national lockdown. The government expects to press ahead with the next phase of easing restrictions on Monday, which will bring the return of international leisure travel, and the reopening of pubs and restaurants indoors. But officials are studying the data on infections, and the final stage of the \"roadmap\" for ending the lockdown and social-distancing rules -- due on June 21 -- is now in doubt, people familiar with the matter said. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government will need to see positive data on infections and new variants for the plan to go ahead next month. \\'Cycle of Infection \"We have got to break the cycle of infection, because one of those big tests was infection rates have to be suppressed, and the other big test is variants,\" Zahawi told LBC radio. \"If those cause a problem, then the tests will fail.\" Still, ministers are more likely to back a targeted surge in the vaccination program in areas where the India variant is more prevalent, rather than order local lockdowns, people familiar with the matter said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson would face resistance from within his ruling Conservative Party to any slowdown in lifting the lockdown. On Thursday, he said he is \"anxious\" about the spread of the India variant. He is due to hold a press conference later Friday. Data from the Office of National Statistics released Friday showed another drop in infection rates, with now just one in 1,340 people in England estimated to be carrying Covid-19 in the week to May 8. (c)2021 Bloomberg L.P.', 'Five of six Indian companies that have entered into manufacturing arrangements with sovereign fund Russian Direct Investment Fund ( RDIF ) for Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V may seek a waiver of conducting local Phase-3 clinical trials One of the six, Hetero Biopharma , had last fortnight obtained clearance from the subject expert committee under Indias drug controller to conduct Phase-3 trials of the Russia-developed vaccine in India.Sauri Gudlavalleti, head of research and development at Dr Reddys Laboratories, which has secured rights to distribute Sputnik V and obtained emergency authorisation in India, said the other five may approach the Indian regulator shortly seeking the exemption.\"It is a technology transfer and not a redevelopment,\" said Sauri, citing that as a reason to seek the waiver. He was responding to media queries on the sidelines of a programme on Monday to announce Dr Reddys arrangement withfor administering the vaccine in 35 Indian cities.Dr Reddys is initially importing Sputnik V and has priced it at Rs 995.40 a dose inclusive of GST. Apollo will charge Rs 1,250 a dose, including the vaccine administration cost.On Hetero Biopharma seeking to conduct Phase-3 trials, Sauri said: \"That is one approach that has been taken. But we will have to see depending on the regulatory approach and pathway to be taken by the rest.\"Dr Reddys expects the other five players to approach the regulator in the next few weeks seeking the exemption, he said.He said local trial production of Sputnik V was expected by late June or early July, to be submitted to the regulator for analysis and testing on the quality to check if it was on par with the imported vaccine.Sputnik V was developed by Russias Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology with the backing of RDIF and was registered by the Russian health ministry as the worlds first Covid-19 vaccine based on the human adenoviral vector platform.RDIF had entered into arrangements with Indian pharmaceutical firms Hetero Biopharma, Gland Pharma , Virchow Biotech, Panacea Biotech, Shilpa Medicare and Stelis Biopharma to produce the vaccine here.Dr Reddys has conducted Phase-2 trials on 100 people in India where it proved safety and absence of adverse events and equivalence of immunogenicity. Subsequently, the Hyderabad-headquartered generic drug firm initiated Phase-3 trials on 1,500 additional volunteers to study the immunogenic response.\"Based on the 42-day immunogenic response, we were given approval for the vaccine,\" said Sauri, adding: \"The trial is continued for the full period of 183 days where we study the relative efficacy, the full extent of the trial.\"Dr Reddys \"would intend to approach the Indian regulator in the next few weeks\" for the single-dose Sputnik V Light to be launched in India, he said, adding: \"We are awaiting all the additional submission requirements and data sets from Russia.\"', 'The first batch of anti-COVID oral drug 2-DG , developed by the DRDO , was released on Monday by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan The Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) approved the 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) drug for emergency use as an adjunct therapy in moderate to severe coronavirus patients earlier this month.In his brief remarks, Singh said the drug has brought a new ray of hope for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.\"This is a great example of the scientific prowess of our country,\" he said.At the same time, the defence minister said that it is not the time to relax and get tired as there is nothing definitive about the course of the pandemic.\"We do not need to be relaxed, nor should we get tired. Because this wave has come for the second time, and there is nothing definite about this. We have to take steps with full caution,\" he said at the event in DRDO headquarters.Singh said the government has taken the overall situation seriously, whether it is the matter of oxygen supply or ensuring ICU beds or the arrangement of cryogenic tankers for transportation of liquid oxygen.\"I am happy to say that the Medical Corps has also decided to take back its retired doctors so that our health system can be strengthened further. I heartily commend such physicians who are joining this campaign even after their service,\" Singh said.The defence minister also listed efforts of the armed forces in helping civilian authorities deal with the situation across the country.However, he asserted that deployment of the armed forces for Covid-relief measures has not impacted their operational preparedness at the borders.\"Even after going through all these difficulties, we have ensured that our preparedness at the border does not have any impact. There is no shortage of enthusiasm and enthusiasm of our forces anywhere. We know this very well, no matter how big the difficulty is, we will overcome it,\" he said.The Defence Ministry on May 8 said that the clinical trials of the drug 2-DG showed that it helps in faster recovery of hospitalised patients and reduces supplemental oxygen dependence.The approval of the drug has come at a time India has been grappling with a record-breaking wave of coronavirus pandemic that has stretched the country\\'s healthcare infrastructure to its limit. The anti-COVID-19 therapeutic application of 2-DG drug has been developed by the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS), a leading laboratory of DRDO, in collaboration with Dr Reddy\\'s Laboratories (DRL) in Hyderabad.The drug comes in powder form in sachet and is taken orally by dissolving it in water, the ministry said.In efficacy trends, the ministry said, patients treated with 2-DG showed faster symptomatic cure than the standard of care (SoC) on various endpoints.', 'The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) Saturday took a stock of telecom infrastructure preparedness to mitigate the impact of a severe cyclone storm Tauktae which is expected to make a landfall in coastal Gujarat on May 18.The intensified cyclone, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) is moving towards Gujarat, and the Union Territory of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli.In order to ensure uninterrupted telecom connectivity in these states Maharashtra and Gujarat, the DoT held a meeting with the telecom infrastructure providers and their representative body Tower & Infrastructure Providers Association (TAIPA).The officials stressed upon the need for availability of adequate diesel at telecom sites, readiness of spare battery sets, and availability of extra Cell on Wheels (CoWs).\"All our members have taken necessary steps to ensure uninterrupted connectivity in these areas which are likely to be affected by the cyclonic storm and all the background arrangements like additional diesel sets, battery banks, spare parts, stocking of diesel are taken care of,\" TR Dua, Director-General, TAIPA said.The Delhi-based group further said that the infrastructure companies have deployed additional restoration teams which are kept on standby mode for all major districts and areas likely to see storm impact.', 'Inflows into equity and equity-oriented mutual fund schemes continued in April but at Rs 3,437 crore, they were lower than Rs 9,115 crore in March 2021.

Systematic Investment Plan (SIPs) inflows were at Rs 8,590 crore in April compared to Rs 9,182 crore in the previous month. \"The net inflows into equity funds have continued in April, which is very encouraging. Flows slowed down a bit compared to March largely because of the disruption caused by the second wave of the pandemic. However, the SIP numbers have remained robust and the addition of SIP folios also have been very healthy,\" said G Pradeepkumar, CEO at Union AMC. He expects flows to pick up once the pandemic is brought under control through increased vaccination and other measures.

The change being sought by the Florida Republican to a package of bills based on a proposal from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Indiana Republican Senator Todd Young offers a preview of the sort of skirmishing that is likely to erupt as Schumer pushes for floor passage of the legislation by the end of the month. Rubios amendment would expand oversight of research funds to include the U.S. intelligence community, requiring the Director of National Intelligence and other agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation to certify that anyone receiving money authorized by the legislation is not susceptible to foreign threats. It also would prohibit people who have received financial or other support from the Chinese government from receiving funds authorized by the legislation, among other provisions. Rubio wants to add his proposals to the Endless Frontier Act, the legislation from Schumer and Young that is forming the backbone of a broader package that will receive floor consideration this week. An initial procedural vote is scheduled Monday afternoon. The main part of the bill would authorize more than $100 billion over five years to boost research and development of innovative technology and manufacturing at colleges, universities and other institutions and create a new entity within the National Science Foundation to focus on technology. Its also expected to include a $50 billion emergency appropriation aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing, as well as funding for a communications security initiative designed to counter Chinas dominance of 5G networks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The package is being pushed toward passage on an aggressive timetable by Schumer. The fervor among Democrats and Republicans to counter about Chinas challenge to U.S. economic primacy has made the legislation, known as the Endless Frontiers Act, one of the few bills to draw broad support at time when partisan divisions are running deep. Its fate also may serve as an indicator for other proposals, such as infrastructure, that have nominal bipartisan support. \"Federal underinvestment in sciences has seen our country slip, exposing critical weak spots in our economy,\" Schumer said last week, setting up the first vote on the legislation. \"If we dont fix them, we will no longer be the number one economic leader in the world.\" Related to that goal is a separate proposal expected to be included that would provide $50 billion for a program aimed at increasing semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. that was passed as part of the 2021 defense bill but never funded. The proposal has gained urgency as a global shortage of semiconductors causes economic pain in the U.S., shutting down auto plants because of a lack of chips for cars and trucks. Semiconductor Supplies Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas has been working on the proposal with Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona along with others and said he expects it will supported by the White House as well as Senate Republicans. President Joe Biden in his broader infrastructure proposal has called for as much as $50 billion to expand U.S. chipmaking. \"If China decided to cut off our supply of semiconductors it would be like the Strait of Hormuz is to oil,\" Cornyn said. \"It would be a disaster economically.\" Despite generally broad support, the Endless Frontier Act was the subject of a sometimes contentious markup session in the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday. Scores of amendments were proposed and some were adopted, sometimes over the protest of co-sponsor Young. In particular, he called an amendment proposed by Democratic Senator Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, a \"poison pill\" because it would divert some of the funding to the Department of Energy for its network of national laboratories. Among those is the Los Alamos National Laboratory (NYSE: ) in New Mexico. Funding Shift \"I am disappointed that an amendment was adopted to divert significant funding away from the NSF Tech Directorate in favor of a program outside of the Committees jurisdiction,\" Young said in a statement after the bill was approved by the committee. The legislation has been carved up into separate tranches, with about half of the money going to the core functions of the National Science Foundation and another almost $30 billion going to help stand up a new tech directorate within the agency. Lujans amendment sends about $17 billion to the national labs. His co-sponsors included GOP Senators Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and John Thune of South Dakota, all of whom represent states where the national labs have a presence. Lujans amendment passed 23 to 5 and the overall bill passed the Commerce Committee by 24-4. Rubio had also called on the Senate floor for the legislation to be directed to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency -- or DARPA -- instead of the National Science Foundation, calling the NSF \"the same agency that time and again has had the research we fund stolen by professors and graduate students who are on the payroll for China.\" Other Republicans, including those on the House Republican Study Committee, Congress largest ideological caucus, said the legislation did not have sufficient protections built into it and called for boosting defense spending rather than spend money on research and development. Such political horse-trading -- along with a bipartisan desire to confront China -- may be key to passage in the Senate. The Endless Frontier Act, which is supported by numerous industry and trade groups, will be combined with a bill passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this year and with proposals from other Senate committees, including Banking and Health Education and Labor. Senators will also be able to offer amendments on the floor. The process for passing the overall package is estimated to take two weeks.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine -- one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show Ramana said Dr Reddy\\'s is trying to secure more doses from RDIF. The company has a commitment from RDIF to get 250 million doses of Sputnik V first and second dose. About 15-20 percent of the initial supplies will be imported from Russia. Dr Reddy\\'s said once the local manufactures begin supplying, which is expected in the next two to three months, the vaccine prices will come down. \"They have to absorb the technology from RDIF, have to get approvals from the regulators and then scale up manufacturing,\" said Sauri Gudlavalleti - Head Of Research And Development. \"We are working with the regulator to bring appropriate guidance, on whether the other Indian suppliers with whom RDIF signed supply agreement will have to do clinical trials or not,\" Gudlavalleti added. Hetero that has a tie-up with RDIF has got permission from DCGI to conduct Phase-3 trials of Sputnik V vaccine. Gudlavalleti said the company intends to reach out to the Indian drug regulator in the next few weeks seeking emergency use authorisation of Sputnik Light single-dose vaccine.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine -- one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.

Foreign brands and products which used to have a lifestyle appeal have now become an integral part of our everyday lives. Disclaimer: Content Produced by Edelweiss Mutual Fund', '(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Bidens $1.9 trillion package will sail through the House when it takes up the bill on Tuesday, according to Democratic lawmakers and aides, even after proposals progressives championed were scaled back. The Senates changes to the House-passed bill, made to appease moderates and comply with parliamentary rules, are unlikely to prove enough to make progressive Democrats vote against it. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can only afford to have four Democrats oppose a bill for it to pass, if all members are voting and Republicans are lined up in opposition, given her partys thin majority. Two Democrats joined a united GOP in voting against the initial version of the stimulus. Pelosi on Sunday predicted the bill will pass. \"In two days, the House will have a resounding, hopefully bipartisan, vote for justice,\" Pelosi said in a letter to her caucus on Sunday. \"We can then send it to the president and move quickly to distribute its life-saving resources.\" Other senior lawmakers agreed. \"I dont think there is any trouble. What Democrat is going to vote against a bill that cuts poverty by a third, expands child tax credits and SNAP, gives $1,400 to 80% of their constituents?\" said Budget Chairman John Yarmuth, a chief architect of the American Rescue Plan bill. SNAP refers to a federal food-assistance program. With Biden now cruising to his first legislative victory less than two months after proposing his relief bill, economists have baked its effects into their forecasts for a stronger recovery in 2021. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ). economists see the unemployment rate tumbling to 4.3% by year-end, from 6.2% in February, with employment climbing by almost 7.4 million for 2021, making up most of the 9.4 million plunge in payrolls last year. \"Growth will be rip-roaring during the coming year,\" Moodys (NYSE: ) Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi wrote Sunday, due to additional fiscal stimulus, the end of the pandemic and consumers emerging from lockdown. The outsize stimulus has propelled a surge in bond yields, with 10-year rates punching through to the highest levels in more than a year last week. Deadline Nears Democratic aides said the looming March 14 expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits makes for a strong disincentive for any rank-and-file members to try to force a renegotiation with the Senate. That could risk missing the deadline, with assistance lapsing. Progressives who had expressed concern about any changes in the Senate so far are holding their fire, with the Congressional Progressive (NYSE: ) Caucus issuing a statement calling the upper chambers changes \"minor.\" Outside groups, like the Justice Democrats and Sunrise movement, were also quiet on the bill over the weekend. The Senate reduced weekly supplemental unemployment benefit to $300 per week through Sept. 6, compared with $400 through August in the House bill. The new version also now lets individuals earning up to $150,000 to collect $10,200 in benefits tax free. Senates Tweaks While the ceiling for zeroing out stimulus checks was lowered to $80,000 from $100,000 by the Senate, the bill now made student-loan relief tax-free. A progressive attempt to add a phased-in $15 minimum wage to the package failed when eight senators in the Democratic caucus voted Friday against waiving budget rules to allow it in the bill. Marathon negotiations Friday night showcased the delicate balance of power in the Senate, and the sway of moderates. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer contended with a move by West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin to back a GOP proposal to phase out the enhanced jobless benefits by mid-July. With Schumer arguing that such a change could cause trouble in the House, Manchin ultimately compromised, and backed the deal to keep aid going until September. Progressive House Democrats are already turning their attention to getting their proposals in a second budget reconciliation bill -- which allows for Senate approval by a simple majority, rather than the usual 60 votes to cut off debate. Congress is expected to take up the next reconciliation bill before the August recess.

By July-end it will be by two to three crores, and their target by August-end is four crore to five crore vaccine doses,\" Sudhakar said.According to him, Krishna Ella and all the directors assured him that they will give vaccines to Karnataka at the earliest.The minister said he asked them to provide a roll-out schedule as well, which they will do soon.Karnataka officials will be in touch with them on how to roll out the vaccine in the state in the coming days.\"Our priority is to get the vaccines to the people of our state at the earliest,\" Sudhakar said.He also said that Bharat Biotech\\'s facility in Hyderabad can produce one crore doses of COVID vaccine a month whereas the Karnataka unit will roll out four to five crore doses a month from August onwards.To a question, Sudhakar said Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa would be holding a meeting in the evening where a detailed discussion will take place on the extension of lockdown following which a decision will be taken.Replying to a query on the Congress questioning the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for allegedly selling the vaccines, Sudhakar said it was donated by the Centre to the COVID affected nations on humanitarian grounds as no one foresaw the severity of the second wave.He said it was highly regrettable that the Congress was indulging in politics despite assuring the government that it will cooperate with it in the fight against COVID.Karnataka has so far conducted 1.12 crore inoculations of coronavirus vaccines in the state comprising first and second doses whereas it has suspended the vaccination of people between the age group of 18 and 44, who are about 3.5 crore, due to shortage of vaccines.The state is battered by the second wave of COVID infections and reported 31,531 infections and 403 deaths on Sunday.There are over six lakh active cases in the state, a majority of whom are in Bengaluru.', 'live bse live nse live Volume Todays L/H More x Larsen and Toubro (L&T) share price fell over 2 percent in early trade on May 17 after the company declared its March quarter earnings.

We expect L&T to witness Core E&C revenue/EBITDA/adjusted PAT CAGR of 12%/11%/17% over FY21-23E. Our estimates largely account for commodity price inflation risk. Our consolidated revenue/EBITDA/adjusted PAT CAGR estimate stands at 14%/17%/28% over FY21-23E, helped by lower losses in the Hyderabad Metro. Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,604 We believe that L&T is well-placed to emerge stronger given its financial, technical and managerial capability for sustaining and gaining market share. Given the strong tender pipeline and healthy order book, we have revised our earnings upwards for FY22E/23E by 4.5%/5.8%. Target price is revised upwards owing to revision in earnings and target market capital of its holdings companies. Dolat Capital | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,718 Our FY23E EPS estimates remain unchanged, while we cut our FY22e EPS estimates by 7% to factor in the impact of restricted business activities especially in H1FY22 due to the lockdown. ICICI Direct | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,700 L&T reported decent order inflows while execution improved amid onsite productivity and supply chain normalisation leading to better margins. Also, better collections improved the working capital situation while cash proceeds from E&A have provided much-needed liquidity comfort and the ability to further repay the debt. We expect L&T to deliver standalone revenue CAGR of 12%, EBITDA CAGR of 11.8% and PAT CAGR of 15.1% in FY21-23E. Sharekhan | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,795 L&Ts strong operational performance along with healthy guidance related to execution, order intake and working capital requirement for FY2022 are key positives emerging out of Q4FY2021 results. The international outlook looks promising for developed economies as they seem to recover faster from the COVID-19 pandemic, while GCC countries are expected to pick up investments with oil staying above USD 60. Bernstein | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 1,708 The Q4 was respectable with strong cash flows & improved margins, still guidance of mid-teens growth for orders & revenues. The message of significant optimism & control over the business will please the markets. Goldman Sachs | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 2,000 It was a strong performance with optimistic commentary. All indicate strong discipline & focus on profitability, while stars are aligning for the next leg of capex uptick in India. Nomura | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,654 It was a strong delivery on core margins/cash flows. The sales rebounded sharply in FY22. The near-term EBITDA margin is susceptible to rising commodity prices. Nomura cut FY22 profit by 2% on near-term execution headwind in Q1FY22. The strong order book & higher services will drive growth into FY23, it said. Kotak Institutional Equities | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,850 The stage is set for the company to deliver high-teens profit CAGR over FY20-23. We do not expect hiccups along the way given the strength of the backlog. JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 1,815 The execution headwinds to be transient. The commodities are not proving to be an unmanageable concern. JPMorgan cut the FY22/23 EPS estimate by 3/4%. The focus on recycling balance sheet & achieving 18% RoE are the key positives. Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Raised to Rs 1,816 The guidance will be a discussion point but its delivered in far tougher fiscal.

The legislative language released by the Education and Labor Committee and Committee on Financial Services shows Democrats are forging ahead with plans to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, and have earmarked $15 billion for airline-worker payroll assistance. These and 10 other committees are meeting in the coming days to assemble the stimulus bill for a House floor vote the week of Feb. 22. Once the bill goes to the Senate, it is designed to be passed with just 50 members plus the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris using a special budget fast-track procedure. House Democrats are showing with Mondays bill text that they will try to increase the minimum wage despite a raging debate over whether Senate rules permit them to do so through the so-called reconciliation procedure. Education and Labor Chair Bobby Scotts draft bill includes the wage increase, which also phases out the lower wage for tipped workers. The committee, set to meet Tuesday to hold votes on the bill, estimates 27 million workers will see a pay increase under the provision by 2025. The draft bill also has $130 billion for kindergarten through 12th grade school reopening and $40 billion for higher-education institutions. Childcare businesses would benefit from $39 billion in funding. The bill would extend pandemic food benefits using $5 billion and expand home heating assistance by $4 billion. Provisions to tighten workplace safety standards for Covid-19 are also included, as is funding to subsidize health insurance for the newly unemployed. Senior-care services would receive $1.4 billion, and money is set aside to combat a rise in domestic violence and child abuse that have come with the pandemic and lockdowns. Homeowner Aid The Financial Services Committee is charged, under the terms of the 2021 budget adopted last week by Congress, with drafting legislation totaling $75 billion in deficit increases. Chair Maxine Waters (NYSE: ) will convene the panel on Wednesday to vote on this portion of the bill. According the committees draft legislation, that will include $10 billion to use the Defense Production Act to produce masks and other Covid-19 equipment, $25 billion for rental assistance, and $5 billion in assistance for the homeless. The bulk of the rental aid program would run through the Treasury Department. Homeowners would benefit from $10 billion for direct assistance with mortgage payments, property tax payments and utility costs. For airlines, $14 billion in payroll assistance would be provided directly to airlines and $1 billion to contractors. The House Ways and Means Committee is planning for a multi-day process to approve the tax portions of the stimulus bill, starting on Wednesday. That text includes another round of relief checks, paid-leave benefits and expanded tax credits for families with children and low-income individuals. It also addresses the extended unemployment benefits that Biden called for in his overall $1.9 trillion proposal.

The most recent example is COVID-19, which was first detected in Wuhan, China. Health experts and advocates have directly connected terms like the \" China virus \" or \" Wuhan virus \" to the recent increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans,\" the SAJA said.The association encouraged journalists to exercise care in their ongoing coverage of the coronavirus surge in India and said it was available to foster fair and accurate coverage of the South Asian community \"SAJA recommends applying the same guidance to any current or future variants of the coronavirus,\" it said.B.1.617, known as the \\'double mutant\\' -- this name comes from two notable mutations found in other variants that appeared together for the first time in this new strain and first detected in western parts of India, the letter stated.At present, B.1.617 and B.1 are the major strains identified from the samples of south India from the positives of the April month data, which is very infectious and is also spreading in the younger age groups apart from the adults.With a total of 4,14,188 new COVID-19 cases being recorded in the last 24 hours, India again reported its highest single-day spike on the second consecutive day.

The junta said martial law was imposed in Mindat in Chin State late on Thursday after whom it called \"armed terrorists\" attacked a police station and a bank. The attacks posed a further challenge to the military as it struggles to restore order in the country amid widespread anger over its coup in February which ousted the elected civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The resistance has expanded in recent weeks from daily street protests and strikes to attacks on junta-appointed administrators and ambushes of security forces by civilians. The newly-formed Chinland Defence Forces on Friday said it was behind the fighting in Mindat. It ambushed a convoy of military reinforcements on Friday, according to one fighter and a local legislator. \"Fighting is still ongoing and Tatmadaw is firing into Mindat town using artillery,\" said the lawmaker, referring to the military by its local name. He requested that he remain anonymous. \"This is the most serious fighting.\" The Chin rebels numbered about 400-500, who between them had about 30-40 assault rifles, plus traditional hunting rifles, he said. \"But they are not trained well,\" he said, adding most had only a week-long training session. A spokesman for the Chinland Defence Force declined to provide details on the fighting, citing security reasons. LOSING CONTROL \"They (the junta) can no longer rule the city except in some areas where they have bases. They have no control in the rural areas,\" the spokesman said. One of its fighters told Reuters six trucks were seized and many weapons taken. A military spokesman did not answer calls from Reuters. The state-run Myanmar News Agency said the fighting on Wednesday and Thursday in Mindat involved 100 people who attacked a police station and about 50 targeting the state-run Myanmar Economic Bank. Security forces had repelled the attack without suffering casualties, it said. The Chin lawmaker said the fighting erupted after the military refused to release seven local youths wrongly detained by authorities. He said five local militia fighters had been killed. News website Irrawaddy said two had died, citing one of the fighters. Pro-democracy groups and ethnic minority armies have been rallying behind a National Unity Government (NUG) that is seeking domestic and international support to undermine the military as prevent it from consolidating power. The NUG earlier this month announced the formation of a People\\'s Defence Force, to protect civilians from the military. Some fighters have sought training with insurgents that have battled the Tatmadaw for decades in border regions. So far, 788 people have been killed in the military\\'s crackdown according to an advocacy group. The military, which disputes that number, imposes tight restrictions on media, information and the internet. Reuters cannot independently verify arrests and casualty numbers. In a sign of the continued defiance, pictures and video on social media showed demonstrators marching in the commercial capital Yangon on Friday chanting \"we believe that we gonna win, we must win, we must win\". Others carried signs saying \"coup must fail\".', 'Moody\\'s Investors Service on Monday said if the second wave of the pandemic does not decline to more manageable levels and results in a prolonged and wider lockdowns, it will have a more severe effect on companies\\' earnings recovery. It said the resurgence of coronavirus infections in India that has led to regional lockdowns will put the brakes on rated companies\\' earnings recovery seen in recent months. Earnings have seen a rising trend since October 2020 following the easing of national and state-level lockdowns. But renewed restrictions in many states will weaken demand for goods and services, and disrupt the recent recovery trajectory. \"India\\'s largely regional and less stringent lockdowns amid the second wave of coronavirus cases so far have had a limited impact on economic activity. If infections fail to decline to more manageable levels, however, lockdowns may be prolonged and widen, which will have a more severe effect on companies\\' earnings recovery,\" Moody\\'s said in a report. It expects the negative impact on economic activity to be limited to June quarter, and that the economy will rebound in the second half of the year. However, if infections fail to decline to more manageable levels, lockdowns may be prolonged and increase in scope. This situation would severely weaken rated companies\\' earnings and derail the recovery seen over the last six months, it added. \"Another nationwide lockdown would have severe disruptions for the whole country, compared with the more contained, state-level restrictions in effect now. A national lockdown scenario would restrict personal mobility on a large scale, lower demand for goods and services, as well as lead to supply-chain disruptions and aggravate labour shortages,\" Moody\\'s said. Widespread movement restrictions will lower demand for transportation fuel and reduce the capacity utilization for oil refiners. Similarly, demand will decline in sectors such as automobiles and real estate as consumers postpone their purchases amid limitations on movement. Lower domestic demand in end-user industries will also reduce capacity utilization for heavy industries like steel, cement, and metals and mining. Long and widespread lockdowns, if imposed, would dampen consumer sentiment and weaken demand for goods and services in general. Consumers will likely defer nonessential purchases, which will lower economic activity in the country. \"A scenario of stringent lockdowns would result in blue-collared workers moving back to their hometowns and manufacturing activity likely coming to a halt. This situation would lead to labour shortages once lockdowns are eased and manufacturing activity resumes. \"As a result, capacity utilization would remain weak even in the immediate weeks and months after lockdowns are eased,\" Moody\\'s added.', \"Santosh Joseph, founder and managing partner, Germinate Investor Services LLP said that a combination of factors, such as global lucrativeness and huge retail and domestic flows, are keeping the market from falling a lot. Many fear a March-April 2020 like situation of selling out and losing out. Therefore, the market is extremely nimble and delicate trying to be ahead of the curve. Aggressive lockdown, vaccinations and drop in new Covid cases, supported by growth recovery should revive the markets in 1-2 quarters, he added. Edited Excerpts:- Q: The second COVID-19 wave disrupted a lot of sectors and there are some sectors which have not seen major impact. Which sectors should one consider for the portfolio and why? Yes. Covid has been a serious disrupter, mover and shaker. Market dynamics and sectoral contributions have changed. From the initial flight to safety in defensives, sell-off in financials, to now major action in mid/small caps across sectors is seen. It's normal to see that FMCG, pharma and IT hold the fort while many discretionary sectors like entertainment, travel and financials take a hit. I personally believe that though you can spot inflection points of sectoral changes, a balanced approach of having many sectors with appropriate weight is still the best way to navigate these markets. For example, the much ignored metals sprung a surprise and many missed it or are joining the party quite late. Always better to be diversified than adventurous, unless you have a strong reason otherwise. Q: The market has been volatile after seeing more than 5 percent correction from record high levels. Do you think the volatility will subside in the coming weeks? The second wave progression is the primary reason for this volatility. I think the market didn't expect such a nasty outcome, especially since the larger part of 2020 was well-managed relative to the global scenario. It's only fair that there is a consolidation, probably on the lower side due to curfews, lockdowns in various state to curb the rising number of cases and casualties. Aggressive lockdown, vaccinations and drop in numbers supported by recovery of growth should revive the markets in 1 or 2 quarters. Q: Brokerages and rating agencies lowered their GDP growth estimates for FY22 due to disruption by the second COVID wave. What is your take? This is tricky to call! And will keep updating largely based on COVID impact. Rather than chase the macro economic headline number, I guess it is better to focus on individual portfolios and use this opportunity to streamline or rejig the portfolio. Q: What should be the investor's strategy in the current circumstances, with respect to portfolio? Is it still a buy on decline market? I guess this depends on the point of the investor's journey. For someone who hasn't started, this is a great market to begin and for others, like I said earlier, it's time to streamline or rejig. Market will be at its best, being volatile on both sides, giving opportunities to enter and exit. Q: India witnessed record additions of Covid cases on daily basis. But the market has not seen a proportionate fall. What are those supporting factors for the market? We have a combination of global lucrativeness and huge retail and domestic flows that are keeping these markets sideways. Many are thinking 3 months to 6 months ahead. Hoping the cases will drop and markets will recover. Many fear a March-April 2020 situation of selling out and losing out. Therefore, the market is extremely nimble and delicate trying to be ahead of the curve. Q: Any of the rules state by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger that one should follow right now? I think the biggest takeaways are discipline in their process of investing and making the most of the given opportunity. They are not afraid to not buy and when they buy, they take huge positions. : The views and investment tips expressed by investment expert on Moneycontrol.com are his own and not that of the website or its management.

Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions.', \"FII selling is one of the primary reasons for the recent consolidation in the market, especially Nifty, where FIIs have large holdings in some of the major constituents, said Jyoti Roy, DVP - equity strategist, Angel Broking. In an interview to Moneycontrol's Kshitij Anand, Roy said Nifty should find support near levels of 14,400 while last week's high of 14,967 will act as a resistance. Edited excerpts: Q) Bears took control of D-Street last week even as the government assured a supply of 2 billion jabs. What led to the price action on D-Street in the week gone by? A) Correction in markets last week was on account of global volatility led by sell-off in tech shares. Moreover, concerns also remained over the trajectory of the second coronavirus wave in India. While there was a clear peak in new cases due to lockdowns in the week gone by, markets are looking for a clear signal as to when state governments will start opening up the economy given that daily new Covid cases still remain significantly high. Q) Small & Midcaps remained resilient in the fall seen in the week gone by. What is fuelling the optimism in the broader market space? A) FII selling is one of the primary reasons for the recent consolidation in the market, especially Nifty, where FIIs have large holdings in some of the major constituents. Mid & small cap indices have held up much better than the Nifty given the lower FII shareholdings and greater interest by domestic institutions and retail investors. Q) What are the important levels to watch out for? And, what should be the strategy as Nifty closes below 50-Days SMA for the week ended May 14? A) While the Nifty may have closed below the 50-day slow moving average during the week, we would not read too much into it. We believe that this week is very crucial for the markets as we have started to see a sharp decline in new daily Covid cases in India. In case we see the trend continuing then there could be some positive price action, especially if global markets remain supportive. On the downside, Nifty should find support near levels of 14,400 while last week's high of 14,967 will act as a resistance level. Any break above last week's highs will indicate that the consolidation is over for the markets. However, a break below levels of 14,400 could see the Nifty retest its previous swing low of 14,150. Q) Sectorally, Utilities rose nearly 5%. What led to the price action? A) Utilities had a good run during the week led by PSU stocks like GAIL, NTPC, PTC and Power Grid as there was significant value buying in PSU stocks. Moreover, a few of the stocks like Adani Transmission also contributed to the rally in the sector. Q) IT index was the top sectoral loser - down over a percent. Can it be attributed to profit booking? A) The sell-off in the IT sector can be attributed to profit booking due to sell-off in global tech stocks, along with premium valuations relative to historical averages. The IT sector has been on a dream run since the beginning of the Covid crisis given faster adoption of digital technologies which has led to an increase in medium term growth potential for the sector thus leading to significant rerating in multiples. We believe that the correction in the sector is going to be short-lived and we continue to maintain our positive outlook due to strong medium-term growth potential. Q) FIIs remain net sellers in Indian markets. What is spooking foreign investors - is it domestic or global factors? A) FII selling in Indian equities can be largely attributed to the second Covid wave in India. The intensity of the second wave has caught all market participants by surprise and FIIs will wait for clear indication that the worst of the Covid wave is behind us before we see a reversal in the outflows. Global volatility led by a sell-off in the Nasdaq also contributed to volatility in the past week.\", '(Bloomberg) -- Mario Draghi agreed to take over as Italys next prime minister, naming his ministers as he prepares to head a new government that will prioritize the pandemic, a struggling economy and moving ahead with European integration. Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, picked the Bank of Italys Daniele Franco as finance minister, and confirmed a Bloomberg News report that Roberto Cingolani, an executive at Leonardo SpA, would head a new ministry for ecological transition. He will be responsible for managing spending on green projects under the European Unions recovery package. Draghi reported back to President Sergio Mattarella Friday evening after two rounds of talks with political leaders. After securing broad support from all the countrys main parties except for the far-right Brothers of Italy, he told the head of state he was ready to form an administration. This is a government \"with a clear European and Atlantist profile,\" said Francesco Clementi, a professor of comparative public law at Perugia University. \"The ministers list shows a great awareness of the technical difficulty of governing in these difficult times, but also of the political perils that brings together very different parties.\" The former governor of the European Central Bank kept Luigi Di Maio as foreign minister, with the new administration set on carving out a bigger role for Italy alongside partners Angela Merkel of Germany and Frances Emmanuel Macron. Draghi has already told lawmakers he will push for a common euro-area budget, and Italy has taken up the rotating presidency of the Group of 20 nations. On the new governments agenda: a pandemic thats claimed more than 90,000 lives in Italy, the worst recession since World War II, and a debt load at almost 160% of output. The cabinet, with several political appointees, reflects Draghis attempt to ensure support from rival forces. Franco, director-general at the central bank, will play a key role in administering Italys 209 billion-euro share ($253 billion) of the EUs recovery package, and in introducing measures to help families and businesses cope with the recession prompted by the pandemic and lockdowns. Other key ministers include Giancarlo Giorgetti, minister for economic development. A veteran senior lawmaker with the League of Matteo Salvini, he has been pushing for the party to adopt a more pro-European stance. (Updates with details of ministers from fourth paragraph) (c)2021 Bloomberg L.P.', '(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. is poised to ban Huawei Technologies Co. from its next generation mobile networks under a two-step plan designed to protect critical communication systems from potential security threats, a person familiar with the matter said. Under the blueprint, British phone companies will not be able to add any new Huawei components to their 5G networks by the end of the year. After that, all existing equipment made by the Shenzhen-based company would need to be removed from 5G networks by 2027, the person said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, his senior ministers and top security chiefs are due to be presented with the proposal at a meeting of the National Security Council on Tuesday, with an announcement expected later in the House of Commons. U.S. War on Huawei Begins to Turn After Europes Rough Year If the plan is agreed at that meeting , it would mark a major reversal by Johnson, and risk escalating tensions between the U.K. and China at a highly sensitive time. Johnson gave the green light to Huaweis involvement in emerging mobile networks in January, subject to limits, but he came under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to change course. Recent additional U.S. sanctions on the company have changed the calculus in London. In May the U.S. banned Huawei from sourcing microchips which use American technology, a move that forced British officials to reassess their view of the security and sustainability of using the companys equipment in 5G networks. The prevalence of chips that are made with or incorporate U.S. technology caused New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu to declare in May that \"Huawei has 12 months left to live.\" At the same time, Johnson has faced demands from within his own Conservative Party to take a tougher line with Beijing. Senior Tories demanded the premier should give firm deadlines for when Huawei will be blocked from Britain, amid concerns its equipment could be used by Chinese spies -- a charge the company denies. (Updates with context, detail from fourth paragraph) (c)2020 Bloomberg L.P.', '* Some countries have authorised shots for children * WHO chief says India of huge concern * Ease rules on mask wearing with caution: WHO (Adds detail throughout) GENEVA, May 14 (Reuters) - The World Health Organization urged rich countries on Friday to reconsider plans to vaccinate children and instead donate COVID-19 shots to the COVAX scheme that shares them with poorer nations. The WHO is hoping more countries will follow France and Sweden in donating shots to COVAX after inoculating their priority populations to help address a gulf in vaccination rates. Canada and the United States are among countries that have authorised vaccines for use in adolescents in recent weeks. However, a WHO official said talks with Washington on sharing doses were under way. understand why some countries want to vaccinate their children and adolescents, but right now I urge them to reconsider and to instead donate vaccines to #COVAX,\" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual meeting in Geneva. COVAX, which has delivered around 60 million doses so far, has struggled to meet supply targets partly because of Indian export restrictions on the AstraZeneca vaccine due to its growing epidemic. So far, around 1.26 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally. Tedros also said the second year of the pandemic was set to be more deadly than the first, with India a huge concern. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sounded the alarm over the rapid spread of the coronavirus through India\\'s vast countryside on Friday, as the country\\'s official tally of infections crossed 24 million and over 4,000 people died for the third straight day. More than 160.71 million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally and nearly 3.5 million have died, according to a Reuters tally. Infections have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019. WHO officials urged caution in lifting measures that contain transmission, such as mask wearing, and warned that more variants were bound to be detected. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised that fully vaccinated people did not need to wear masks outdoors and could avoid wearing them indoors in most places. few countries are at the point where they can drop these measures,\" said Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan.', 'Non-banking finance companies ( NBFCs ) have managed to survive the first wave Covid inflicted slow down but given the persistence of infections, the full effects of the lockdown and suspension of business on their asset quality will only be known gradually, Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) said in its monthly bulletin.Among sectors NBFCs lend to, industrial sector, particularly micro and small and large industries, were the hardest hit by the pandemic as they posted decline in credit growth.However, NBFCs in the retail loan sector stayed ahead of the curve aided by their relatively low delinquency.Incremental credit flows to the retail sector continued to grow in the second and third quarter of fiscal 2021 led by vehicle loans, gold loans, transport and tourism.\"Players in the retail segment stayed above the curve by gauging the public sentiments and playing to their strengths. With the persistence of the pandemic and the need for observing social distancing norms, passenger vehicles sales increased by 13.6 per cent in December 20207. It is mirrored in the disbursal of vehicle loans by NBFCs, as these loans grew by 10.7 per cent in Q3:2020-21. Loans against gold also grew robustly as it filled in the cash requirements and possible working capital requirements of small firms. However, incremental credit to industries declined in the same period as the sector is yet to shake off the impact of the pandemic,\" RBI said.NBFC profitability had dropped in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to the Covid induced lockdown, however, the situation improved marginally in the second quarter. NBFCs return in assets (RoAs) and return on equity (RoE) improved from 1.8% and 10.3% respectively in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to 2.3% and 12.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.Asset quality of NBFCs also witnessed an improvement in 2020-21 due to regulatory forbearance on declaring of NPAs. Both gross as well as net NPA ratios fell in the third quarter if fiscal 2021 compared to the previous year.RBI however acknowledged that the true extent of NPAs in the sector may be gauged in the upcoming quarters as the interim order by the Supreme Court on asset classification standstill was lifted in March 2021.Overall though consolidated balance sheet of NBFCs grew at a slower pace in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2021 due to challenges due to Covid and lower demand for loans, NBFCs continued to disburse credit despite the disruptions.\"The retail sector benefitted from incremental credit disbursed by the sector, aided by their low GNPA ratios and by staying tuned to customer preferences. The profitability of the NBFCs improved in Q2:2020-21 compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year on account of steeper fall in expenditure than in income,\" RBI said while admitting that the future of the sector will now depend on how it copes with the second wave of Covid.', '(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic hurt American financial well being, but the impact differed widely by education, income and race, a Federal Reserve survey showed. \"The pandemic caused substantial disruptions to many peoples finances, as well as to their daily lives, even while public-policy responses appear to have muted many of the effects,\" the Fed said in its 2020 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking released Monday. \"A clear pattern from the survey is that financial challenges in 2020 were uneven, and frequently left those who entered the year with fewer resources further behind.\" Almost 25% of adults in the U.S. were worse off financially than the previous year -- the highest since the survey began asking the question in 2014. That compared with 14% in 2019, the survey showed. Those with a bachelors degree, high earners and White Americans were less likely to be impacted by the economic crisis than those with a high-school education or less, low-income individuals and Americans of color. While 75% of all adults reported they were \"doing OK\" by November, only 45% of those without a high-school degree said so, compared with 89% of those with a bachelors degree. Some 80% of White Americans and 84% of Asian Americans reported doing OK financially, compared with 64% each of Black and Hispanic Americans. Financial hardships caused by the pandemic were counterbalanced by financial-relief and stimulus measures, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. But, by November 2020, financial well-being based on these measures had edged back down, the survey showed. Laid Off Last year, 14% of Americans were laid off. Of workers aged 25 to 54 without a bachelors degree, 20% were laid off, compared with 12% of those with at least a bachelors. More than 20% of Black and Hispanic workers lost jobs, compared with 14% of White workers. More Americans saw their income increase than decrease last year, driven by gains for top earners. Almost 30% of adults with at least a bachelors degree saw an increase in their bank account balance after paying bills, compared with 16% who saw a decline. Some 6% of those with less than a high school degree saw an increase, compared with 25% of those who saw a decline in their balance. Working parents reported problems with child care and work as the pandemic shut down many schools to in-person learning. Almost 75% of parents with school-age children said their childs school was partly or completely online. Some 11% of mothers and 6% of fathers said they werent working due to child-care or in-person schooling disruptions, meaning a drop of almost 2 percentage points in the number of adults working overall. Black, Hispanic, single and low-income mothers were more likely to be impacted by child-care and schooling disruptions. Some 36% of Black mothers and 30% of Hispanic mothers said they werent working or were working less because of these gaps.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine -- one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.

The first phase of the programme will kick off with vaccinations in Hyderabad on Monday and in Visakhapatnam on Tuesday (May 18) at Apollo facilities.The vaccinations would follow the SOPs as recommended by the government including registration on CoWIN.Hospitals\\' Joint Managing Director Sangita Reddy said the healthcare major would receive 10 lakh doses of the COVID-19 vaccine over a period of one month.\"Delighted to share @HospitalsApollo has Ptnr with @drreddys 2 admin #SputnikV the 1st foreign-made #vaccine to be used in #India to all DRL staff. Additionally, we will be receiving 1 Mn doses (over 1 mth period ) 4 our public #vaccinationdrive as #IndiaFightsCOVID19,\" she tweeted.For the pilot programme, Apollo would receive the Sputnik V vaccines from the first batch of 1.5 lakh doses imported by Dr Reddy\\'s so far.After Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam, the pilot programme will be extended to Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Kolkata, and Pune.Elaborating further, Apollo Hospitals President - Hospitals Division K Hari Prasad said in a statement:\"This pilot phase will allow Dr Reddy\\'s and Apollo to test the arrangements and cold chain logistics and prepare for the launch. We are confident that with the Sputnik V vaccine , we will be able to make a significant contribution to ease availability and access to COVID vaccines to the community at large.\"With the opening of the vaccination programme for the private sector, the healthcare major has intensified efforts to accelerate the rate of inoculation through opening vaccination centres across its hospital network, he added.\"We are also in discussions with corporates to undertake vaccination on their premises. We are currently administering COVID vaccine at 60 locations across the country including Apollo Hospitals, Apollo Spectra hospitals and Apollo Clinics,\" Prasad said.Dr Reddy\\'s Laboratories CEO - Branded Markets (India & Emerging Markets) MV Ramana noted that the two entities were working to scale up the pilot and take the vaccine to other cities with an aim to inoculate as many Indians as possible.In August 2020, Russia became the world\\'s first country to register a coronavirus vaccine, dubbed as Sputnik V.Following that, in September, Dr Reddy\\'s Laboratories and Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) entered into a partnership to conduct clinical trials of Sputnik V, which is developed by the Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology.Dr Reddy\\'s Laboratories has received approval from the Indian drug regulator for restricted emergency use of Sputnik V.', 'For the second consecutive year, sales of air conditioners (ACs) and refrigerators have been hit during the peak season of April and May due to the localised lockdowns and restrictions on account of surging Covid cases in the country. The pandemic situation has forced companies to recalibrate their target and go for pre-Covid (2019) sales number without being too aspirational.Leading players in the segment including, Panasonic and Haier reported almost 75 per cent dip in April sales this year when compared with the same month of 2019 performance. Moreover, May 2021 has been a complete washout so far for them.On top of the present situation, consumer sentiment has been further hit amid reports that there may be a third wave of the pandemic, which further dampens chances of a recovery in sales of compressor-based cooling products such as ACs, refrigerators etc, as people are preferring to keep expenses on hold till the time Covid situation improves.Leading AC maker Voltas said it was expecting a double-digit growth this fiscal but now the second wave and subsequent restrictions have led to a recalibration of targets.\"Initially while budgeting, we had a lot of aspirations to grow more than double digits - but now due to the first quarter getting washed out, our endeavour will be to catch up with last year,\" Voltas MD and CEO Pradeep Bakshi told .Expressing similar views, Daikin Airconditioning India MD & CEO Kanwal Jeet Jawa said: \"If we are able to achieve what we have done in 2019, that would be good enough.\"Last year, April was washed out and May was just 10 per cent (of May 2019) and June was less than 25 per cent of (June 2019 sales).Sales in April this year were 80 per cent of those clocked in the corresponding month of 2019 as only first 15 days of the month were good in terms of activities. May is looking like a complete washout and June could be 75 per cent of 2019, Jawa said.Panasonic India and South Asia President and CEO Manish Sharma said the sale of AC started in March on a positive note, but due to the sudden surge in the number of cases in the second wave and most of the states imposing partial lockdowns, summer sales are being hit.\"We are keeping a close watch on the situation but, we may see a loss of over 50 per cent against sales projections during the ongoing quarter (April-June). We have inventories in stock to ensure a smooth purchase experience for our partners and consumers across offline and online channels,\" he said.Normally, the April-June quarter, as mercury rises in the peak summer, contributes around 30 to 35 per cent to overall sales of ACs and other compressors based cooling products.According to the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA), the entire month of May, which is a period for peak sales of cooling products, would be almost a washout for the industry, as only 15 per cent of the market is open and footfalls at stores are negligible.\"I am looking at the trend\", which is similar to that of last year, said CEAMA President Kamal Nandi.According to Haier Appliance India President Eric Braganza, the only hope is these lockdowns and curfews are restricted till June but the problem is that by the end of that the season would be over.\"This is a crucial month and if you lose it, then you can not make up,\" he said adding that in AC segment, there would be no growth and it would be like last year. \"We were expecting this year to be better than 2019 but again it would like 2020.\"However, companies such as Blue Star are still hopeful and are expecting double-digit growth despite these obstacles.Given the poor penetration level of the category, sales should pick from June onwards helped by factors such as pent-up demand and work-from-home, etc.\"My estimate is 10 to 15 per cent growth for the year,\" said Blue Star Managing Director B Thiagarajan.Bakshi said Voltas will try its best to catch up in the next few quarters.\"In terms of matching up to our performance in last to last year (2019-2020), it is too early to say right now as it depends on several factors. If the summer season is longer, humid, harsher and continues till July, maybe we will be able to match those numbers,\" he said.However, CEAMA president Nandi warns about a possible hike in prices for residential ACs on account of continued inflationary pressure on inputs.\"Industry has to take the balance hike of 20 per cent, they have already increased 12 per cent so far and has to take the rest 8 per cent. A hike will happen as things become normal. This whole impact of the price increase and disturbance and disruption would have a challenge in the second quarter also,\" said Nandi.Unlike last year, when the market picked up in July and August, this year people are talking of the third wave, Haier\\'s Braganza cautioned.\"Last year after the pandemic people were not scared. This year, the mental frame of people is going to be different. People are going to save money anticipating the third wave as people have to incur money on the medical bill. I do not think that the market would respond the way it had done last year,\" he said.The Indian residential AC market is estimated to be around 7 to 7.5 million units per annum and over 15 companies compete in the segment.', 'By Amlan Chakraborty and Sudipto Ganguly NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, May 13 (Reuters) - For someone who lost a season to a nagging elbow injury that needed surgery, Indian javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra understandably welcomed the postponement of the Tokyo Games last year. The mop-haired former world junior champion, potentially independent India\\'s first track-and-field Olympic medallist, had hoped to use the extra time to get back to full fitness and try to find his best form. Instead, the 23-year-old was soon sent scurrying back indoors as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world\\'s second-most populous nation, then surged again in a devastating second wave this year. Chopra is one of 90-odd Tokyo-bound Indian athletes who have spent much of the last 12 months agonising over the loss of precious practice time in an Olympic year. \"There\\'s been an extended period of over two years since I competed in an international competition,\" the javelin thrower recently told Reuters. \"As an athlete, there\\'s only so much one can train and the lack of competition is definitely a factor that\\'s been playing on my mind.\" India leads the world in the daily average number of new deaths reported, accounting for one in every three deaths reported worldwide each day, according to a Reuters tally. was hoping to train and compete in Turkey this month but the Athletics Federation of India suspended their camp after being told the athletes would have to complete two weeks of hard quarantine on arrival. The frustration for aspirant Olympians has been palpable and athletes like table tennis player Sathiyan Gnanasekaran have been forced to innovate to stay sharp during the lengthy lockdowns. Left with no practice partner last year, the tech-savvy paddler used a ping pong robot he had imported from Germany and finally booked his Tokyo spot in March. \"It can fire around 120 balls per minute. It\\'s basically like a feeder one but you can add a lot of randomness into it,\" the 28-year-old told Reuters by telephone. \"You can set up the ball trajectory and frequency, you can set up the spin and speed, you can set up like one ball close to the net, and then the other one at the far end of the table. \"So this is very close to what we practise with a coach or with a fellow player.\" ROBOT V HUMAN Sathiyan has since turned the roof terrace of his Chennai home into a sports hall, ordered a new table just like the ones he will play on in Tokyo, and roped in a local player to practise against. \"Definitely robots can\\'t be compared to humans. I prefer sparring with humans any day,\" he said. \"You miss that human touch. You miss those moments, like seeing openings and placing them in the right place.\" Elsewhere in Chennai, fencer Bhavani Devi faced the same challenge last year when her qualification hopes appeared hanging by a thread in the absence of a sparring partner. The 27-year-old came up with a concrete plan -- literally -- piling bricks and slabs together under a kitbag with a fencing mask attached to it to create a dummy partner. \"It was not a new idea for me,\" the sabre fencer told a virtual news conference on Wednesday, recalling the early days of her fencing career when she could not afford a proper sword and practised with bamboo sticks. \"I used to mount my mask on the wall and do my partner-training those days. It came from that. \"It gave me the feel of fencing with an opponent,\" said Devi, who earlier this year became the first Indian fencer to qualify for an Olympics, booking her spot at the World Cup in Hungary. Boxer Vikas Krishan roped in his family to help, teaching his father to hold the punching bag at his Bhiwani home. \"Having competed at two Olympics, I know what it takes to succeed at the highest level and I am not allowing anything to come in my way,\" the 29-year-old welterweight told Reuters. \"My only aim for Tokyo is to win for India and I have focused all my efforts and energy to achieving that target.\" (Editing by Nick Mulvenney and Peter Rutherford)', 'The rupee rose for the second straight session on Monday to close 7 paise higher at 73.22 (provisional) against the US dollar on the back of positive domestic equities and weak American currency.

A few families had to cope with the sudden loss of a loved one and assume the unexpected responsibility of running a home. We want you to know that you are not alone, and we are here to support you,\" Shah wrote to M&M employees numbering around 25,000.The \\'Family Assistance Policy\\', he said further enhances the support of one-time payment of twice the annual compensation that the company has provided over the past year, he added.\"A significant addition is a financial support in the unfortunate event of the demise of a colleague, we will pay salary for the next five years; over and above the one-time payment of 2x annual compensation,\" he said.The salary will be paid to the spouse or dependents of the deceased as per defined guidelines.Shah also said M&M will support \"children\\'s education till Class 12\" with Rs 2 lakh per annum per child along with financial planning assistance through advisory services.Stating that M&M has taken several steps to combat COVID-19 and keeps its employees safe, he said the company through tie-ups with medical providers will enable a smoother process of vaccination apart from covering the cost of vaccines.The company has achieved almost 100 per cent vaccination of employees above 45 years of age by April-end, he said adding \"we are now working with multiple hospitals to set up vaccination clinics across the country\".M&M has also made available a team of 27 doctors across India for its employees in case of any staff or family members showing symptoms and the company will \"arrange for RT-PCR and antigen tests on priority, including home visits\", Shah added.In case hospitalisation is required, he said, \"We will cover all expenses plus provide Rs 1000 per day as an allowance towards miscellaneous expenses\".reover, he said, \"All costs for quarantine and hospitalisation will be covered for the immediate family. And for other dependent family members, we will provide financial assistance only in specific need-based cases, per defined guidelines\".further said the company has also supported its dealers and their 80,000 employees by covering vaccination expenses, providing medical insurance, home quarantine, and \"ex-gratia payment in the unfortunate event of death\", Shah said.

India\\'s need to bolster and expand its healthcare infrastructure is urgent and compelling,\" Holkar told .Since March 2020, when the pandemic started, it has witnessed \"sustained rising demand\" for many of its key healthcare products and solutions.\"Currently, the healthcare sector\\'s revenues contribute less than 10 per cent of Godrej & Boyce\\'s total revenues. However, we believe that this sector presents strong growth opportunities even after the pandemic ebbs,\" she added.Godrej & Boyce has not shared its revenue from its healthcare sector business.The company is sensing great opportunity by the government plan to strengthen the medical cold supply chain.\"Take, for example, the need to strengthen our medical cold supply chain. While vaccine fridges are the immediate need, the government has also announced plans to create 65 new blood banks at the district level,\" Holkar said.Such precise cooling solutions are also critical for organ storage banks and pharma cold chains including testing labs, she added.\"With Godrej & Boyce\\'s technology and engineering capabilities as well as a range of suitable products, we plan to play a significant role in these areas,\" she added.On being asked as to whether Godrej & Boyce is open to working with COVID-19 vaccine makers such as Pfizer, Holkar said, \"As an organisation, we believe in strong partnerships and collaborations.\"The company, in partnership with the UK-based The Sure Chill Company, sells medical refrigerators that use the properties of water to keep vaccines in the desired temperature range.\"Now, as procurement of vaccinations has been opened up for private sector corporations and hospitals, we are also looking at partnerships and collaborations in this regard,\" she added.When asked about the local value addition of the products sold into the healthcare sector, Holkar said, \"Around 90 per cent of the products that Godrej & Boyce sells in the healthcare sector are through local value addition.\"\"As an organisation, we are committed to a self-reliant India. Keeping that in mind, we are constantly working towards increasing this ratio through local manufacturing, sourcing and collaborations,\" she added.Last year, for instance, Godrej & Boyce has invested 10 per cent of its healthcare revenues back into the business.\"At Godrej & Boyce, investment is a continuous process and we are continuously scanning the horizon to scout for investment opportunities for our businesses,\" she said.In the past 14 months, it has built a new manufacturing plant for Godrej Interio at Khalapur, Maharashtra , with a production capacity of 300 hospital beds per day among other healthcare accessories.\"Similarly, in FY20, Godrej Appliances increased its manufacturing capacity by 300 per cent by making investments in foaming plugs, jigs and conveyor lines. Even at component levels, multiple tools were developed to match plant production capacity,\" said Holkar.Godrej & Boyce also exports its medical refrigerators to over 36 countries covering Africa, the Middle East and SAARC and will continue to focus on these regions.However, currently, most of its healthcare products and solutions are focused towards the Indian healthcare industry.\"Even after the COVID-19 era, there is an immense potential to further upgrade the healthcare infrastructure in order to bolster India\\'s immunisation drive. Having said that, the international markets too offer significant opportunity,\" she said.Holkar also said, \"Going forward, we see an opportunity to step up our exports even further.\"', 'The government on Monday revised the clinical guidance for Covid-19 treatment, dropping the off-label use of convalescent plasma as it was found not beneficial in reducing the progression to severe disease or death.', 'With Cairn Energy dragging Air India assets to the legal battle with India on the retrospective tax issue, legal experts indicate that India is the least favourite in winning the legal war with the company and the option before the country is to go for an out-of-court settlement or to win the appeal filed against the order. The battle between the government of India and Cairn Energy in the retrospective tax issue has taken a fresh twist last week with the latter filing a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York, seeking to make Air India liable for the judgement that was awarded to Cairn. The move to sue Air India is to enforce a $1.2 billion arbitration award that it won against India in a tax dispute case. According to legal experts, the only legal option before India is to succeed in the appeal filed in Hague, although the chances are very less. Where India is standing legally? In December, a Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague had ruled that the Indian government should pay damages worth $1.2 billion to the company and a case of retrospective tax was wrongly applied on Cairn. The court had ruled that the claim by the Indian government was \"in breach of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment\". Later, India opted to appeal against the judgement. Since the arbitration process kicked off, the UK-based company was looking for Indian assets abroad for enforcing the award. This included Air India, oil and gas assets, cash held by state-run banks abroad and also Indian ships. The award was given based on an investment treaty arbitration administered by the Permeant Court of Arbitration (PCA) with a finding of unfair and unequal treatment, expropriation by the government of India by way of retrospective tax legislation. \"Cairn Energy has every right to enforce the award globally against the assets of GoI, as per the New York Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Awards. Air India being a state-owned company, would be treated as an asset of the government of India,\" said S Ravi Shankar, senior partner, Law Senate, a New Delhi-based arbitration firm. Shankar added that if the Court attaches Air Indias assets situated in the US, they may auction them and pay the proceeds to Cairn. \"The only legal option is to succeed in the appeal filed, although the chances are very less,\" he said. Although the GoI has challenged the arbitration award in The Hague, it is pending, and there is no direction barring Cairn from enforcing the award. \"On the face of it, the lawsuit does not seem to be misconceived, although, as I understand, the carrier hasnt received any notice to date. This lawsuit has global repercussions for the GoI as this may trigger multiple enforcement actions around the world against assets of the government of India. The case could serve as a means for Cairn to seize Air India aircraft that land on US soil and other assets,\" said Mohit Goel, Partner, Sim And San. Is there precedence? Earlier this year, a Malaysian court allowed the seizure of a Pakistan International Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft that landed in Kuala Lumpur after Dublin-based AerCap had filed suit in a British court over unpaid dues. The jet was released nearly two weeks later after the two sides reached an amicable settlement. In 2019, a Jet Airways aircraft was seized by Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) in Schiphol over unpaid fees. Similarly, in 2019, the battle between ConocoPhillips and Venezuela too had grabbed headlines. ConocoPhillips had approached the US courts to seize Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA\\'s assets to collect $2 billion compensation it had won in an arbitration against Venezuelas 2007 takeover of its assets. PDVSA had to pay the full amount later ConocoPhillips. Based on previous experiences, experts indicate that the Cairn Energy arbitration has a strong legal standing. \"A combined reading of the New York Convention, the existing UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty, and international law clarifies that the arbitral award has a solid legal standing. The issue of enforcement of the said award seems to be dicey. It could result in a setback in its disinvestment process as the government of India had recently invited financial bids,\" said Krusch Antony, Partner - Arbitration, King Stubb & Kasiva.', 'The Mumbai airport is shutting down flights from 11 am to 2 pm Monday as Cyclone Tauktae blows over Mumbais coastline.An airport spokesperson said just one Chennai-Mumbai flight was diverted to Surat.The flight tracking app Flightradar however showed at least 10 cancellations of domestic flights between midnight and 12 noon today, including those coming from Goa and Kerala which have been hard hit by the cyclone.The weather department said the cyclone is now proceedings towards Gujarat.', \"The Delhi international airport will shut down its T2 terminal from Monday midnight as the number of flights have reduced significantly due to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, sources said.From Monday midnight, all flights will be handled at the T3 terminal only, they stated.Currently, the Delhi airport is handling around 325 flights per day, they mentioned.

India is in the grip of the highly transmissible B.1.617 variant of the coronavirus, first detected there and now appearing across the globe. Modi said his government was \"on a war footing\" to try to contain it. \"The outbreak is reaching rural areas with great speed,\" he said, addressing farmers in a virtual conference. \"I want to once again warn all ... those who live in villages about corona.\" Although about two-thirds of Indians live in rural towns and villages where healthcare facilities are limited, it was the first time Modi has specifically referred to the virus\\'s spread through the countryside since a second wave erupted in February. \"All departments of the government, all resources, our armed forces, our scientists, everyone is working day and night to counter COVID, together,\" he said. Eid festivities celebrated by India\\'s around 200 million Muslims to mark the end of Ramadan were generally subdued on Friday. Most states have imposed full or partial lockdowns and many mosques were either shut or following social distancing measures during prayers. \"The good thing is that everyone is following and celebrating Eid inside their homes,\" Maulana Khalid Rashid, a cleric in the city of Lucknow, told ANI news agency, a partner of Reuters. Television has broadcast images of families weeping over the dead in rural hospitals or camping in wards to tend the sick, while bodies have washed up in the Ganges as crematoriums are overwhelmed and wood for funeral pyres is in short supply. Medical journal The Lancet said restrictions on movement along with international support measures were urgently needed to stem \"an unprecedented public health crisis\". Modi has been under pressure to impose a national lockdown, though on Thursday the president of the Public Health Foundation of India questioned whether that would be effective in India. \"We recognise... the anxieties that are displayed by international observers... but you can\\'t wrap all of India into one blanket,\" K. Srinath Reddy told a panel discussion. Health ministry data recorded 4,000 deaths and 343,144 new infections over the last 24 hours, below last week\\'s peak of 414,188. Total infections since the pandemic struck India more than a year ago crossed 24 million, with 262,317 dead. Experts say the true figures are much higher, with a lack of access to tests and treatment meaning many cases go uncounted. Modi has faced criticism over his leadership during the pandemic, having allowed a huge Hindu gathering to take place in northern India in February and addressed political rallies in April, blamed for spreading the virus to rural areas. FAST-SPREADING VARIANT The fast-spreading variant first found in India has caused alarm around the globe. It has led to big outbreaks in neighbouring states such as Nepal, and has also been detected far afield in Britain, the Americas and elsewhere in Asia. Yamini Mishra, Asia-Pacific director of rights group Amnesty International, said the virus was \"spreading and transcending borders at a frightening speed\" and would hit the region\\'s most marginalized populations hardest. The catastrophe unfolding in India and Nepal should also be a warning to other countries the region \"to invest heavily in surge capacity for an emergency response,\" she said. Modi allowed all Indian adults to request vaccines from May 1. But while India is the world\\'s largest vaccine producer, the huge demand has left it low on stocks and vaccinations have slowed down. As of Friday, it had fully vaccinated just over 39.4 million people, or around 2.9% of the population. The government has promised to accelerate the vaccine programme dramatically in coming months. More than 2 billion doses of vaccine are likely to be available between August and December, government adviser V.K. Paul told reporters. Those would include 750 million doses of AstraZeneca\\'s vaccine, which is made by Serum Institute of India, as well as 550 million of Covaxin, developed by domestic producer Bharat Biotech. Dr Reddy\\'s Laboratories Ltd said a first batch of Sputnik V vaccine imported from Russia received regulatory clearance on Thursday and the first dose was administered on Friday as part of a pilot.

The House had already adopted its budget resolution but will likely have to vote again Friday to agree on the Senates language. Once thats done, Democrats will be able to craft a relief bill in the coming weeks that can pass without any Republican votes under special budget rules -- though the White House, moderates like Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and others still say they want a bipartisan final product. Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders said adoption means help is on the way to those suffering from an \"economic collapse.\" \"Tonight we can say to them we understand the pain that they are experiencing and we are going to do something about it,\" Sanders said. House and Senate committees would have until Feb. 16 to write the stimulus legislation under the instructions in the budget. The final action early Friday followed an all-night marathon of votes on amendments known as a vote-a-rama. Most of the non-binding measures were intended more to make points on hot-button issues like taxes, abortion, immigration and schools that had little or sometimes nothing to do with pandemic aid. There were 41 roll call votes during the process. Democrats mostly held together to beat back the Republican amendments, but on several issues centrist Democrats displayed their clout in the 50-50 Senate and delivered a message to Biden and progressives that they wont get everything on their wish list. \"This was a giant first step,\" Majority Leader Charles Schumer said, noting the vote came exactly one month after two new Democrats were elected in Georgia, handing the majority to his party. Democrats did have a series of defections on energy-related amendments, though none supported a proposal aimed at barring a federal carbon tax. That amendment, offered by Republican John Hoeven of North Dakota, failed on a 50-50 vote. Seven Democrats voted to oppose a ban on fracking and two opposed Bidens decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline -- potential warning signs as Democrats prepare a package on climate change legislation. The Senate agreed to amendments against a near-term increase in the minimum wage during the pandemic and against stimulus checks for \"upper income\" individuals. While non-binding, these could prefigure a delay in the wage phase in or a tighter cap in who gets checks. The latter amendment, a bipartisan proposal from Manchin and Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, sought to prevent upper-income people from receiving government stimulus payments. They argued it didnt make sense for $1,400 checks to go to wealthier families, though their amendment didnt specify a particular income level. It passed 99-1, with only Kentucky Republican Rand Paul in opposition. The adoption of the budget, assured by the presence of Harris, marked the clearest sign yet of the of the Democratic takeover of the Senate, even if its by the slimmest margin. No Republican has yet backed anything close to the $1.9 trillion sought by Biden, with many in the GOP pivoting to austerity politics as they did in 2009 with a Democrat sitting in the Oval Office. Republicans complained Biden was taking a partisan stance while spurning a $600 billion offer from 10 of their senators. Democrats held firm against efforts to tie school funding to reopening schools, arguing the whole point of the money is to help schools safely reopen in the first 100 days of Bidens presidency. The non-binding amendments can set the stage for follow-on action -- or campaign ads against senators in future elections. One immigration amendment by Ted Cruz split the GOP, with 60 senators blocking his proposal opposing an expansion of work-related visas until the economy fully recovers. That could signal a slim possibility of reaching a bipartisan immigration deal later this year -- a major Biden priority. Just before final adoption, the Senate stripped out three amendments -- on the Keystone pipeline, fracking and banning stimulus checks for undocumented immigrants. Those measures could have caused the budget to lose votes in the House. Lawmakers clustered in tight groups on the Senate floor as they talked and debated policy. It was a scene reminiscent of last years impeachment trial of then-President Donald Trump and one that foreshadowed his second trial, set to begin in less than a week. The pandemic that has continued to rage around the country seemed an afterthought but for the masks that all but one of 100 senators wore. The exception was Paul. Some of the senators on the floor were experiencing their first vote-a-rama after taking office this year: Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Marshall of Kentucky, Alex Padilla of California, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of Georgia. Democrats are already planning another budget reconciliation package later this year for other items, including on climate legislation. (Updates with Schumer comment in eighth paragraph) (c)2021 Bloomberg L.P.', 'These three pointers will help improve the relationship between Sales and Marketing This is a perennial issue in small and medium businesses. Are sales and marketing different or the same? Should it be different functions or the same? Do companies mean sales when they say marketing? I am not going to discuss the fundamental differences between these two functions here. I will only say that sales and marketing are two sides of the same coin. You need both, as marketings role is different from sales and it is important to maintain a healthy relationship between the two. What is the relationship in your company between marketing and sales? How do sales folks rate their relationship with marketers? Bringing alignment between sales and marketing is one of the biggest challenges faced by most SMEs today - especially in the B2B sector. If done right, the benefits are many: Effective marketing planning, lead generation, conversion, and overall results of sales and marketing. Together, they can do many powerful things within the company, commanding better delivery from production, supply chain and other support functions. When companies examine the drivers to operational efficiency and profitability, they find that a key issue is defining shared processes in sales and marketing. The way content is generated in collaboration with sales and how marketing takes responsibilities for lead generation are important in driving better harmony in the relationship between sales and marketing. The best of the B2B organisations we have worked with in the past have shown some interesting best practices, which could be of big use to others. For instance, in the best of the companies, more than 46 percent of the sales leads forecasted are generated by marketing as compared to the industry average of 21 percent. Where sales and marketing have been in sync, companies have grown double the industry average. Best in class companies also ensure that sales and marketing have regular meetings every week, at least 50 percent more than the other companies. These companies have demonstrated the regular coordination between the two functions by deliberately constituting joint working groups for special projects such as key account management or a new marketing campaign. Such organisations also take the performance of marketing functions seriously in that an individual or team will be made responsible. More importantly, these companies share such performance details of campaign success and failures with the key stakeholders. Wherever sales and marketing have performed in sync, there were common templates and data sheets for each to share and collaborate on. They have also built in whitepapers, case studies and CRM data for seamless use between the two functional teams instead of waiting for the other to ask and respond back, thereby saving time and bureaucratic tangles. These interesting findings bring us the key question: How can other companies become a best in class performer? What do these benchmarks offer companies to shape up and drive sales and marketing together? Here are a few pointers: > Get marketing and sales to work together by making sales \"own\" the customer in terms of bringing customers views to marketing. This will make marketing to act on inputs that are on-ground, real time and owned by a colleague. This may not completely replace market research but someone within the organisation will start listening to the customer seriously. By doing this, marketing will have to bring in content that is in tune with what sales requires. This along with the shared templates, whitepapers, case studies, collaterals, etc can be very powerful in driving alignment between sales and marketing. More importantly, this will send the right message to all concerned for driving alignment. > Assign an individual or a team to have responsibility for marketing performance. Most successful, best-in-class companies do this and it has seen tremendous results. This has a high probability of making sales and marketing work together in sync. It is important for marketing to get its act right and this kind of responsibility assignment and monitoring is the first step in driving a good process of working closely with sales. Alignment is a result of such small but firm steps in an organisation. Companies that have average performance should immediately plan this as part of marketing operations in order to get the ball rolling in the right direction. > Once campaigns are done, make sure that the results are shared across all stakeholders, primarily with sales. More than just measuring and reporting to the CEO, it is more impactful for alignment to share the learning and best practices across stakeholders. This is what best -n-class firms do.

This proposal if accepted by the court is their last window of hope for some extra time to pay up their dues.\"Both the telcos have informed the DoT that they have paid what they could and are not in a position to add to the upfront payments,\" a government official told ET. \"They have raised issues with DoT\\'s calculations as well.\"Vodafone Idea has even warned that it would shut shop unless allowed to pay in instalments.The dispute over statutory dues has been ongoing between telcos and the government for nearly 16 years. It culminated in an October 2019 Supreme Court order backing DoT and widening the definition of AGR to include non-core items.This left some 16 telcos - most of them either defunct or having exited India or merged with others - facing Rs 1.7 lakh crore by way of dues comprising of license fees, spectrum usage charge, interest and penalties to the government. Airtel and Vodafone Idea - being among the oldest operators - were the worst hit.DoTs latest stance is in line with the Supreme Courts observation in its previous hearing that the telcos need to make some upfront payment, to avail of a staggered payment mechanism.\"Although the telcos have also told the top court that they cant pay more, DoT wont take any chances and will need to show that they are doing their best to recover the dues,\" a second official told ET.In the previous hearings, a three-judge bench led by Justice Arun Mishra had slammed the department on several issues, including not making attempts to recover the AGR dues on time.The bench, also comprising Justices MR Shah and S Abdul Nazeer, had in June directed the telcos to file audited balance sheets of the past 10 years - after Vodafone Idea highlighted its stressed financials, and to come up with payment proposals, and asked the telecom department to consider them.As per DoTs calculations, Airtels dues are Rs 43,980 crore and Vodafone Idea\\'s Rs 58,254 crore.The telcos had previously pleaded to the Supreme Court to grant them a 20-year timeline to pay their AGR dues without any additional bank guarantee or personal guarantees or upfront payments.', 'live bse live nse live Volume Todays L/H More x Bharti Airtel share price was trading in the red in the morning session on May 17 ahead of its Q4 results.

A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine -- one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.

The 40-minute, pre-dawn offensive killed 13 Palestinians, including a mother and her three children whose bodies were pulled from the rubble of their home, health officials in Gaza said. The Israeli operation included 160 aircraft as well as tanks and artillery firing from outside the Gaza Strip, Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus said. Palestinian rocket barrages against southern Israel swiftly followed on the fifth day of the most serious fighting between Israel and Gaza militants since 2014. Egypt was leading international efforts to secure a ceasefire and ensure the conflict does not spread. Security sources said neither side appeared amenable so far but a Palestinian official said negotiations intensified on Friday. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, urging a return to peace in the region. the Islamist group that rules Gaza, launched the rocket attacks on Monday, in retaliation for Israeli police clashes with Palestinians near al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam\\'s third holiest site, in East Jerusalem. Violence has since spread to cities where Jews and Israel\\'s minority Arab community live side by side. There have also been clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli security forces in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where health officials said seven Palestinians were killed on Friday. At least 122 people have been killed since Monday in Gaza, including 31 children and 20 women, and 900 others wounded, Palestinian medical officials said. Among eight dead in Israel were a soldier patrolling the Gaza border, six Israeli civilians - including two children, an elderly woman and an Indian worker, Israeli authorities said. SYSTEM OF TUNNELS The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said there were reports of more than 200 housing units destroyed or severely damaged in Gaza and hundreds of people seeking shelter in schools in the north of the coastal enclave. Israel says it makes every effort to preserve civilian life, including warning in advance of attacks. we were targeting is an elaborate system of tunnels that spans underneath Gaza, mostly in the north but not limited to, and is a network that the operatives of Hamas use in order to move, in order to hide, for cover,\" Conricus told foreign reporters, adding that the network was known as \"the Metro\". Israeli warplanes bombed the houses of three senior Hamas military commanders in central Gaza on Friday that had already been evacuated, local residents said. An Israeli plane also bombed the building that housed the National Production Bank in Gaza City, with bricks and debris sent flying and windows shattered in some nearby buildings, witnesses said. Dozens of mourners took part in the funeral of six people - members of two families whose houses were hit by Israeli air strikes on Thursday - in the southern Gaza town of Rafah. Holding the cloth-bound body of his 19-month-old nephew in his arms, Khamees al-Rantissi said their house was bombed without prior warning. \"What was this child doing? What threat did he pose for the state of Israel?\" Rantissi asked. Netanyahu said on Thursday the campaign \"will take more time\". Israeli officials said Hamas must be dealt a strong deterring blow before any ceasefire. The Israeli military\\'s build-up of forces on the Gaza border has raised speculation about a possible repeat of ground invasions during Israel-Gaza wars in 2014 and 2009, but Israel is loath to risk a sharp increase in military casualties. FLURRY OF DIPLOMACY Egypt was pushing for both sides to cease fire from midnight on Friday pending further negotiations, two Egyptian security sources said, with Cairo leaning on Hamas and others, including the United States, trying to reach an agreement with Israel. \"The talks have taken a real and serious path on Friday,\" a Palestinian official said. \"The mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations are stepping up their contacts with all sides in a bid to restore calm, but a deal hasn\\'t yet been reached.\" The hostilities have fuelled tension between Israeli Jews and the country\\'s 21% Arab minority. Violence continued in mixed communities overnight after street fighting and tit-for-tat attacks that prompted Israel\\'s president to warn of civil war. Sheikh Ikrima Sabri, who led Friday prayers at al-Aqsa Mosque, decried the treatment of the mosque by Israeli forces. He said its \"sanctity has been violated several times during the holy month of Ramadan\" in what he called violations \"unprecedented\" since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Israel\\'s military said a Palestinian tried to stab a soldier near the West Bank city of Ramallah. The soldier shot the attacker. Palestinian health officials said the man was killed. Major airlines have suspended flights to Israel and at least two owners of tankers delivering asked to divert from Ashkelon to the port of Haifa, farther north of Gaza, because of the conflict, shipping sources said on Friday. There were pro-Palestinian protests in Jordan and Lebanon, on the borders of the West Bank and Israel, and in Bangladesh, where thousands marched from Dhaka\\'s national mosque. But the broader picture across the Middle East and the Islamic world, where Muslims are marking the Eid al-Fitr holiday and where restrictions on movement due to COVID-19 are in place in some countries, was noticeably muted. The U.N. Security Council will publicly discuss the worsening violence on Sunday, diplomats said after the United States had objected to a meeting on Friday. The Israeli military has put the number of militants killed in Israeli attacks at between 80 and 90. It said that so far, some 1,800 rockets have been fired at Israel, of which 430 fell short in Gaza or malfunctioned.

Among workers who had a job in February 2020, almost 37% were no longer with their employer a year later, according to a paper by Alexander Bick of Arizona State University and Adam Blandin of Virginia Commonwealth University. Almost 26% had a different employer, and the remaining 11% were out of a job. The historically high level of churn, or rate of change, underscores the colossal challenge of bringing back millions of people to the labor market as the economy reopens. Millions of workers who lost their jobs in the spring of 2020 were back at work in March this year, and the paper implies that the recovery is largely due to people finding new jobs, rather returning to their old employers. \"Shocks in the initial months of the pandemic may have permanently destroyed a large share of employer-worker matches, many of which may have been highly productive,\" the authors wrote. \"Because highly productive matches are costly to find, the economic disruption induced by Covid-19 may have induced persistent reductions in productivity and employment.\" For people who had been at their job for less than two years before the pandemic, the churn was much higher, according to the study. Almost 62% had separated from their workers a year later, versus about 16% for those who had been employed by the same firm for at least a decade. This could help explain the current labor shortage, especially in the restaurant, entertainment and hotel industries, which lost the most jobs during the pandemic and are now struggling to hire fast to meet brisk demand. Turnover is traditionally high in those sectors. All economic crises result in job losses. But the most striking difference during the pandemic is that a quarter of workers had a new employer a year after Covid-19 hit, said Bick and Blandin, who use a benchmark U.S. Census Bureau population dataset as the basis of an online survey to collect labor data in real-time. Thats almost twice as large as the next highest rate, about 13% in 1997. \"Generally, some amount of labor market churn is healthy because it indicates employers and workers alike feel confident they can find the right job and employee match,\" said Daniel Zhao, an economist at the employment site Glassdoor. \"However, churn is currently elevated due to the lingering hangover from the ongoing pandemic. Were nowhere near a recovered labor market where workers are quitting out of confidence rather than need.\" (c)2021 Bloomberg L.P.', \"India's electricity use fell 6.2 per cent during the first half of May compared with the second half of April, government data showed, as coronavirus lockdowns imposed by states across the country stifled power demand Total daily average electricity supply to states fell to 3,666 billion units during the first sixteen days of May, compared with 3,910 billion units during the second half of April, data from federal grid regulator POSOCO showed.Industries and offices account for half the country's annual electricity consumption.

By 11:30 AM ET (1530 GMT), futures were up 1.0% at $66.03 a barrel, while futures were up 0.8% at $69.26 a barrel. Crude remains essentially rangebound between $65 and $70 a barrel, with the market having found a broad equilibrium as OPEC and its allies gradually open their taps in response to a global economic recovery. However, near-term gains have been made easier by signs of profit-taking from financial players last week. CFTC data released on Friday showed hedge funds and other money managers sold the equivalent of 31 million barrels in the six main futures and options contracts in the week to May 11. They had bought a cumulative 102 million barrels over the previous four weeks. Data published overnight, meanwhile, had shown Chinese refineries continuing to operate at an average daily throughput rate of over 14 million barrels a day, reassuring the market that the worlds second-biggest oil consumer remains in rude health - even if the year-on-year gains in industrial production are slowing. In Europe, meanwhile, the U.K. took its biggest step back toward economic normality by lifting or relaxing a broad swath of restrictions on business and social activity in England. The lifting of a ban on non-essential international travel is part of that package of measures, something that should help restore demand for jet fuel in a region where it is still depressed. The number of passengers using U.S. airports again hit a new post-pandemic high at the weekend, with 1.85 million people travelling on Sunday, according to the Transportation Security Administration. However, thats still around one-third below pre-pandemic levels. Globally, the level of flight movements remains even below that.

We have been in touch with state governments for vaccination for the balance staff. The first stage was 45 years and above and the frontline workers like medical staff and RPF. They have been completed,\" Sharma said while addressing a press briefing.He said that now the thrust is on those aged between 18 to 45 years.\"We are in touch with the states, number one, to finish the 45 years and above group of people, now, not many are left. Secondly, to quickly cover our 18-45 age group in different states.\"We are in touch with the states, as the railways carries essential commodities, we run the Oxygen Expresses and meet the coaching requirements of passengers.

We have increased our number of beds. Till last year, we had 2,539 COVID beds, now 6,972 beds. We had 253 isolation beds, now we have 573.

Initial claims in regular state programs fell by 34,000 to in the week ended May 8, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 490,000 claims. The prior weeks figure was revised up to 507,000. The labor market continues to improve as more Americans get vaccinated and consumer demand picks up, helping spur economic activity. As more businesses and states lift remaining pandemic restrictions, hiring is expected to continue to accelerate. Claims data have been volatile during the pandemic amid backlogs, fraud and new programs. Also, several states including South Carolina and Montana have recently said they plan to pull out of federal unemployment benefit programs amid a debate about whether generous aid is playing a role in why businesses are having a hard time hiring workers.

AT&T (NYSE: ) and Discovery (NASDAQ: ) are on the verge of merging their media assets. Chinas economic rebound loses steam as the year-earlier weirdness passes out of its calculations, and England takes its biggest step back to economic normality - just as a new strain of Covid-19 arrives on its shores. Heres what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, May 17th. 1. Musk stirs trouble in Cryptoland Crypto assets sold off sharply across the board after Elon Musk hinted on Twitter that Tesla (NASDAQ: ) may sell some or all of its holdings. A subsequent tweet from Musk saying Bitcoin hasnt sold its Bitcoin and doesnt intend to did little to restore the spirits of most digital currencies. Musk reiterated his newly-developed distaste for Bitcoins environmental impact, notably the key role of coal played in the mining process. He also twisted the knife by tweeting that DogeCoin was in a better position to become a mainstream means of payment, saying it would \"win hands down\" if it adopts the kind of approach to faster processing that Bitcoins closed community refused some three years ago. By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), Bitcoin was down 7.3% at $45,389, having earlier touched a three-month low. However, all other major crypto assets were also down, including , which fell 4.3% to just over 50c. 2. Dreaming of a new streaming giant AT&T is on the verge of a deal to combine its WarnerMedia unit with Discovery, creating a new streaming giant with a market value of some $150 billion, according to various reports. WarnerMedia, which houses HBO, CNN and the Warner Brothers movie studio, accounts for nearly half of AT&Ts $230 billion. Discoverys market cap of $18 billion is largely accounted for by its successful ventures into streaming unscripted cooking and home refurbishment shows. Had it come a couple of months earlier, the deal would have generated a handsome payoff for Bill Hwangs Archegos Capital, which had placed a big and highly leveraged bet on Discovery. There were few details about how the deal would be structured, but the deal has the potential to unlock substantial value for AT&T shareholders, who have seen their returns crimped by the huge load generated by the merger of AT&T with TimeWarner in 2016. On the subject of unlocking value, another stock likely to be in focus later is JD.com (NASDAQ: ), whose logistics arm said it would aim to raise some $3.4 billion through an IPO in Hong Kong of a 10% stake. 3. Stocks set to open lower, unsettled by Crypto sell-off U.S. stock markets are set to open the week in cautious mode, against a backdrop of the selloff in crypto that may bode ill for other high-beta assets such as technology stocks. By 6:30 AM ET, were down 100 points, or 0.3%, while were down 0.3% and were down in parallel. Crypto aside, the emergence of a new and more highly transmissible strain of the Covid-19 virus in India has cast fresh doubt on the world economys path to reopening. Taiwan closed its borders to foreign arrivals overnight, while Singapore has closed its schools for most students. In the U.K., London mayor Sadiq Khan was quoted as saying that there were over 400 confirmed cases of the new strain in London alone. 4. Chinas rebound normalizes, housing boom continues Chinas rebound from Covid-19 is flattening out, data released during the Asian session showed. The year-on-year rate of industrial output growth slowed to 20% from 24.5% in April, in line with expectations, while retail sales growth slowed more sharply, to 17.7% from 34.2%. The numbers are a foretaste of what western data will look like as the extreme year-earlier bases pass out of headline calculations, although sustained high processing of by the countrys refineries suggest the short-term dynamic is not losing any meaningful amount of momentum. Chinas housing market also continues to froth, with urban house prices rising by the most in eight months in April. 5. England reopens, just in time for a new Covid-19 strain The U.K. took its biggest single step yet back to economic normality, with a significant relaxation of restrictions on business and social life in England. The indoor hospitality sector is once again open, albeit subject to capacity limits, while meetings of multiple households are now also possible. The ban on non-essential international travel has also been lifted, although the small number of countries on the U.K.s \\'green list of destinations suggests the tourism season is set for a weak start.

In the last meeting of the CoC held on Saturday, financial creditors, which includes representatives of lenders and homebuyers, discussed their bids and sought various clarifications. During the meeting, both NBCC and Suraksha were asked to make necessary changes and submit their revised bids.In this fourth round of bidding process, NBCC is offering up to 1,903 acre, while Surakasha group has proposed to give 2,651 acre to lenders. Suraksha group has earmarked 1,486 acre to dissenting lenders out of the total land parcels offered in the proposal.NBCC has provided an additional 377-acre land in case dissenting financial creditors are not satisfied with its original offer of 1,526 acre, taking its total offer to up to 1,903 acre.

In March this year, the Supreme Court remitted to the CoC the issue of approval of resolution plan for Jaypee Infratech Ltd (JIL), saying no new expression of interest would be entertained for taking over the firm and only NBCC and Suraksha Realty could file revised proposals.

BSE midcap and smallcap indices added 1.6 percent each. \"The markets have zoomed past a resistance block of 14,850 and this should keep the Nifty bullish. Strong support lies at 14,700 and the index would turn bearish if we break this level on a closing basis. If the Nifty can keep above 14,850, we can claim higher levels of 15,000 and then 15,200. If we break 14,700, the markets could fall further to 14,400,\" said Manish Hathiramani, Proprietary Index Trader and Technical Analyst, Deen Dayal Investments. Among individual stocks, a volume spike of more than 100 percent was seen in Balkrishna Industries, Federal Bank and Colgate Palmolive. A long buildup was seen in Balkrishna Industries and Trent, while a short buildup was seen in Escorts, Voltas and Cummins. Here is what experts say investors should do on May 18: Chandan Taparia, Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives, Motilal Oswal Financial Services The Nifty opened gap up above 14,750 and moved north throughout the session. It recouped losses of the last three sessions and closed near the days high with gains of around 250 points. Technically, it formed a healthy bullish candle on the daily scale and negated its formation of lower highs-lower lows of the last three trading sessions. It has to hold above 14,900 to witness an up move towards 15,050 then 15,150. On the downside, support exists at 14,700 and 14,600. On the options front, Maximum Put OI is at 14,000 followed by 13,500 strike, while maximum Call OI is at 15,000 followed by 14,800 strike. Call writing is seen at 15,300 and 15,400 strike with unwinding at 15,000, while Put writing is seen at 14,800 then 14,700 strike. Options data suggests a higher shift in wider trading range in between 14,600 and 15,200 zones. The Bank Nifty has to hold above 33,333 to witness an up move towards 34,000 and 34,250, while on the downside, support exists at 33,000 and 32,750. Mazhar Mohammad, Founder & Chief Market Strategist, Chartviewindia.in The Nifty50 appears to be on the verge of a breakout as it erased losses of the last three sessions on May 17. The larger trend, however, will remain sideways unless the Nifty registers a strong breakout above 15,000 on a closing basis. Moreover, the price action of the last 50 trading sessions evolved into some sort of descending channel with valid touch points. As the Nifty is trading close to the upper boundary of the channel, a close above 15,000 can facilitate a sustainable upmove with bigger targets. In between, the Nifty needs to sustain above 14,725 to retain a bullish stance as a lower close can again embolden the bears. Traders are advised to wait for a breakout above 15,000 before initiating long positions on the index. Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research, Kotak Securities On reports of a sharp decline in coronavirus cases in India, we saw a smart recovery in the market. The financial sector did extremely well and the Bank Nifty gained 1,000 points to close 4 percent higher. The markets rallied throughout the day and closed at the highest point of the day. If global markets remain supportive and domestic news flow is favourable, then we would see 15,000 or 15,050 at the opening on May 18. A weak opening at around 14,870-14,850 will be a buying opportunity. The focus should be on financials, auto and commodities stocks with a short-term view. Ashis Biswas, Head, Technical Research, CapitalVia Global Research The Nifty witnessed some decisive trends and an attempt to overcome the resistance level around 14,950. While sustaining above 14,950 is vital from a short-term perspective, the market has to stay above the level to move towards 15,100-15,200. Momentum indicators like RSI and MACD have to recover after staying neutral to bearish in recent times. Ajit Mishra, VP-Research, Religare Broking Ltd Markets started the week on a robust note, tracking favourable cues domestic and global cues. Upbeat global markets triggered a firm start, which got a boost from a decline in coronavirus cases. Markets are cheering early signs of virus peak and stability in the global markets. But, we feel, participants shouldnt read much into a single-day rise and wait for a decisive break above 15,000 in the Nifty. For that, the performance of the banking and financial pack will be keenly followed. Participants should continue with a positive yet cautious approach and focus on risk management.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday advised that fully vaccinated people did not need to wear masks outdoors and could avoid wearing them indoors in most places.', 'According to experts, the supermarket chains need to relook their approach towards \\'e-commerce or online deliveries. live bse live nse live Volume Todays L/H More x Grappling with low footfalls for more than a year now, supermarkets across the country are rejigging operations with a renewed focus on home deliveries. Future Retails hypermarket retail chain Big Bazaar had announced its two-hour delivery initiative last month in April. The company claims that it is already servicing about 55,000-60,000 orders in a day through various channels such as its app, website, and WhatsApp. \"We have seen a phenomenal response towards this initiative and aim to get about 35-40 percent business through home deliveries in the next six months,\" said Pawan Sarda, Group Chief Marketing Officer Digital, Marketing and E-commerce, Future Group. The company is offering home delivery service across its 284 stores in the country. Other supermarkets such as Avenue Supermarts-owned DMart, More Retail, too, have been pushing home deliveries as they witness a decline in footfalls due to COVID-induced curbs. DMart, over the last year, has expanded its e-commerce offering DMart Ready to four new locations besides the Mumbai Metropolitan Region -- Ahmedabad, Pune, Bangalore and Hyderabad. More Retail is looking at an omnichannel play and pushing deliveries through phone calls, WhatsApp, and beta testing an app at several locations in the country. Reliance Retail, too, through its hyperlocal grocery delivery platform JioMart is eyeing the home delivery space. The company runs hypermarket chains such as Reliance Fresh and Reliance Smart. The race to the customers doorstep The $3 billion e-grocery segment is at an interesting juncture as Reliance Retail pushes JioMart, while Tata Group, too, vies for the share of the pie through its majority stake in BigBasket. Walmart-owned Flipkart, (Flipkart Supermarket), Amazon (Amazon Fresh and Amazon Pantry), and Grofers are other players in the segment. Now, with supermarkets, too, entering the fray, the segment is bound to get fiercely competitive. However, BigBazaar, DMart, and other hypermarket chains have work cut out for them. Sample this, last year, according to BigBasket co-founder Hari Menon, the e-grocery platform was servicing 2.83 lakh orders a day. Grofers, co-founder Albinder Dhindsa announced last year, was clocking 1.9 lakh orders a day. With its 55,000-60,000 orders a day, BigBazaar has a long way to go. Analysts project that BigBasket currently has the highest, about 30-35 percent of the market share in the online grocery segment, followed by Grofers at 20-25% share, while Amazon commands a 20 percent share in it. JioMart and Flipkart both have only 5-6 percent share each in it, as per estimates. \"BigBasket has built customer loyalty over time and consumers are sure about the quality of their service and apt deliveries. Others will have to match up to this,\" said Sanjeev Kumar, Forecast Analyst, Forrester Research. However, supermarket chains such as DMart and Big Bazaar, Kumar said, have a considerable brand recall, which could work in their favour. To gain ground in this intensively competitive segment, however, the companies would have to invest significant capital and resources. \"The companies need to invest towards building logistics capabilities, inventory management software, and AI technologies,\" said Kumar. Though third-party logistics solutions providers can also be roped in, he added, it would mean an impact on their margins. According to experts, the supermarket chains also need to relook their approach towards \\'e-commerce or online deliveries. \"Most of these chains have been trying to make us shop the way Americans do, but in India, deliveries have always been a part of grocery business at local kirana level, where the owner supplies several products to the customer over a phone call,\" says Harminder Sahni, founder and MD of management consulting firm Wazir Advisors. These companies need to think like an online company and allocate resources accordingly, he adds, instead of treating it just as another business avenue. Dwindling footfalls The move towards e-commerce is a need of the hour for supermarket chains, as they report a decline in footfalls at their stores due to localised lockdowns across the nation. Reliance Retail, while reporting its quarterly earnings informed that footfalls at its stores, which stood at 88 percent of the pre-Covid levels in the fourth quarter of FY21, dropped to 35-40 percent of the pre-COVID levels in April. DMart, too has been impacted. \"In general, more than 80 percent of our stores are operating for a significantly lower number of hours (not exceeding four hours per day) or are even shut for operations for one to two weeks or shut on weekends. These shutdowns are having an adverse and severe impact on our revenues,\" Avenue Supermarts shared while announcing its earnings for the quarter-ended March (Q4FY21). Modern trade, which includes supermarket chains, was on the verge of recovery in the January-March quarter, revealed Nielsens FMCG snapshot. As per the research agency, the channel witnessed over 15 percent contraction between the July-September quarter last year, which improved to 8.3 percent de-growth in the first quarter of the calendar year 2021. It contributed about 9 percent to overall FMCG sales in the country from January-March, 2021 as compared to 10.4 percent in the corresponding period last year. The new set of restrictions can further derail this growth unless the new omnichannel play comes to the rescue of supermarket chains.', \"By Geoffrey Smith Investing.com -- Fears of the U.S. economy running hot receded on Friday after new data showed a slowdown in consumer spending in April. were flat on the month, falling short of expectations of a 1% gain.

Here too, the March figure was revised upward to a gain of 9.0% from an initial estimate of 8.4%. The figures once again testified to idiosyncracies in consumer spending patterns as the economy emerges slowly and unevenly from the Covid-19 pandemic: sales at auto dealerships rose 3.1% on the month, corroborating the robust demand for cars that had also been evident in the sharp rise in prices for vehicles in April's inflation report earlier in the week. By contrast, sales of apparel fell 5.1% and sales at hobby and sporting stores fell 3.6% on the month, having surged in March. March's data had been skewed by the effect of stimulus checks arriving at households across the country which, coupled with the start of economic reopening, had resulted in an explosion in overall spending.\", 'on Friday said it will work with US retail giant Target Corporation again, almost five years after Target terminated its contract with the Gujarat-based textiles maker over alleged lapses in labelling and marketing of Egyptian cotton products.\"The company and Target Corporation, a retailer with over 1,900 stores in the USA, will be working together again, having recently completed a vendor re-empanelment process with Welspun Global Brands Ltd., company\\'s subsidiary,\" Welspun India said in a regulatory filing.Welspun India said until 2015-16, the business with Target Corporation accounted for almost 10 per cent of its overall business.\"The company shall strive to foster a strong, transparent and sustainable business relationship with Target Corporation going forward,\" the company said.In 2016, Target Corporation had terminated its contract with Gujarat-based Welspun over alleged lapses in its products supply.Shares of Welspun India were trading 4.55 per cent higher at Rs 95.35 apiece on BSE', 'The Nifty50 snapped its three-day losing streak and recouped all losses in a single session to close above 14,900 on May 17, backed by banks, metals and auto stocks as well as a drop in coronavirus infections.

Industrial output rose 9.8% in April from a year earlier versus the median estimate for a 10% increase. Retail sales expanded 17.7% in the period, far slower than a projected 25% rise. Fixed-asset investment grew 19.9% in the first four months of the year, in line with forecasts. The unemployment rate was lower at 5.1%. While Chinas economy has stabilized at a firmer footing in April, its still challenged by the pandemic and an uneven recovery globally as well as a fragile basis for recovery at home, the NBS said in a statement. The nations top leaders recently described the recovery as \"unbalanced and unstable,\" pledging further efforts to drive a rebound in domestic demand. Sheng Laiyun, a vice head of the National Bureau of Statistics, said earlier this month theres still a gap between actual and potential growth, suggesting the recovery has still some way to go. \"We did see that retail sales continued to disappoint,\" Jian Chang, chief China economist at Barclays (LON: ) Plc told Bloomberg TV. Thats consistent with data over the Labor Day public holiday at the beginning of May, which indicated peoples willingness to travel has recovered to pre-Covid levels but actual spending was still lagging, she said. Manufacturing Investment Chinas stock benchmark CSI 300 Index extended gains to as much as 1.8%, with consumer discretionary and information technology sub-gauges leading the rally. Industrial production remained robust on the back of a recovery in global demand, with fiscal stimulus and faster vaccine rollouts in many places helping to keep export growth strong. Rising raw material prices was likely a constraint in some areas, as is the push to cut output in sectors like steel and coal to lower pollution. On a two-year average basis, which corrects for distortions from base effects, manufacturing investment was down 0.4% in the first four months of the year, while infrastructure investment was up 2.4% and property grew 8.4%. Retail sales growth on an average two-year basis softened to 4.3% in April from 6.3% in March, with the consumption of goods and catering services both turning weaker. A separate report from the NBS suggests the property market remains strong, with home prices rising at the fastest pace in eight months in April. Authorities have pledged a gradual scaling back of the monetary and fiscal stimulus pumped into the economy last year, with no sharp turn in policy. Recent data shows a notable slowdown in credit in April, suggesting the exit might be materializing at a faster-than-expected pace. The central bank injected medium-term cash into the financial system Monday to match the amount falling due, a move largely expected by analysts. In March, the Peoples Bank of China told banks to curtail loan growth in the coming months and keep it at roughly the same level as last year. The pace of local governments debt sales to finance infrastructure projects also slowed sharply in January to April compared to the same period in previous years, according to Bloomberg calculations.

Adding that the company continues to engage in active dialogue with the regulatory authorities and government in India to deliver baricitinib donations through the humanitarian aid organization, Direct Relief and to donate Lillys anti-COVID-19 treatments, including Lillys neutralizing antibodies.Lily has issued voluntary licenses for Barcitinib to six Indian drug makers besides Natco, these include-, Dr Reddy\\'s,, Torrent Pharma and MSN Labs. Barcitinib, in combination with Remdesivir , received emergency approval last year from the USFDA for treatment of hospitalized Covid19 patients who are not on ventilator. Barcitinib is normally used to treat arthiritis. India\\'s drug regulator granted an emergency approval to the Lily and Natco pharma last week.Lily\\'s was pushed to issue the VL to Natco after the government of India intervened in an attempt to put an end to the legal dispute over the drug.

But in its applications to the Supreme Court Natco has said that as an applicant it \" it will be making its Baricitinib formulation available at a cost of INR 30.00 per tablet\". The company has said that the total cost for the treatment of 14 days usng the drug will be Rs 420.00 for a patient. It had appealed for the CL on the grounds that Lily\\'s brand was costing Rs 42287, for a 14 day regimen.\"The Applicant has not sought for a stand-alone non- Covid-19 approval and instead has consciously limited its request to the DCGI for Covid-19 treatment alone following the EU Authorization granted by the USFDA\", said the petition from Natco. Natco\\'s company spokesperson did not respond to a text by ET asking the company whether it still continues to sell the drug at the price it had mentioned to court.In early May, US drug maker MSD also issued voluntary licences to Indian drug makers ---Cipla, Sun, Emcure, Hetero and Dr Reddy\\'s--- for its anti viral drug Molnupiravir.

As per a report by these two ministries, they together account for producing and supplying around 6,650 MT of medical oxygen out of the daily allocation of 10,000 MT in India. In addition, the 13 oil PSUs are establishing more than 100 oxygen generation plants at different hospitals across the country.The information was shared by Dharmendra Pradhan, union minister for steel and petroleum, in a series of social media posts.\"Under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi ji, the steel and petroleum industry have rallied together and are making every effort to help India combat the second wave of the Covid19 pandemic better and stronger,\" Pradhan wrote.With demand for medical oxygen growing every day, the public and private sector steel plants have ramped up their daily production capacities. The production was 538 MT per day on April 1 which has now been increased to 4,278 MT on May 12. The steel plants also have a storage of 25,000 MT of oxygen currently which is supplied to states as per demand.The oil PSUs are playing a major role in offering logistical support in carrying the oxygen to different states. The PSUs have contracted 207 ISO tankers with a capacity of 4214 MT to augment the last mile deliveries of oxygen. These companies have also placed orders for high-capacity oxygen compressors for filling oxygen cylinders. Currently, all these tankers are being used to supply oxygen to 12 states.Petroleum PSUs have also tied up with Singapore and Gulf countries to import 13,740 MT of liquid oxygen. Work is also going on to establish captive oxygen generation plants at 93 locations across the country by oil companies.Pradhan said ONGC is procuring one lakh oxygen concentrators. The company has already placed orders for 52,000 concentrators and 4,800 concentrators have reached.Apart from oxygen supply, these companies are playing a big role in setting up more than 10,000 hospital beds across the country.

Recent data from retail intelligence platform Bizom shows FMCG sales fell 16 percent month-on-month (MoM) in April. The decline was led by a 12 percent fall at kirana stores and 4 percent reduction in stocking, as per the data from Bizom. However, sales of some categories such as branded edible oil and rice (non-basmati) were much better than confectionaries, which declined 20 percent MoM. Commodities and healthy foods gain, yet again Sale of most commodities except for edible oil and rice was impacted in April because of reduced out-of-home consumption of foods and the impact on hotels, restaurants, and cafes, but branded rice and edible oil fared well due to higher at-home consumption, said Akshay D\\'souza, chief marketing officer, Bizom. \"The overall commodity market grew slightly in lower single digits. Among these, edible saw a strong increase of 8.5 percent MoM, which indicates that people are stocking up these products due to restricted movement,\" he said. \"Branded rice (non-Basmati) also witnessed a 3.6 percent MoM increase in sales,\" he added. Healthy foods are also faring well. Marico has seen significant growth in its healthy foods portfolio in the January-March quarter, which grew 134 percent in value terms in Q4 and crossed Rs 300 crore in turnover in FY21. This growth trajectory, the company claims, continues. \"We have seen an exponential rise in our immunity-boosting range during the last month. Our brands such as the Saffola Immuniveda range of Golden Turmeric Milk Mix and Kadha Mix are showing an upward trend of above 100 percent growth at the start of this month as compared to April,\" shared Sanjay Mishra, COO, India Sales and CEO, New Business, Marico. According to Mishra, these products had an unprecedented demand on e-commerce, which has more than doubled its business at the beginning of this month as compared to March. Snacking on decline Unlike last year, confectionaries have struggled.

Traders and fund managers sometimes decide on the direction for gold by looking at the spot price -- which reflects bullion for prompt delivery -- instead of futures. Golds breakout began Sunday evening in New York as the Asian session for the new week went into play. Even prior to that, longs in the yellow metal had an interesting couple of weeks amid arguments about runaway U.S. inflation after a raft of upbeat data on and prices, and . The Federal Reserve acknowledges that there are price pressures arising from bottlenecks in U.S. supply chains struggling to cope with demand in an economy reopening after months of pandemic-suppression. But the central bank insists that these inflationary pressures are \"transitory\" and will fade as the economy makes a full recovery from the pandemic. It also says it does not see the need for now to raise interest rates. Such an environment heightens golds natural role as an inflation hedge, say longs who are emboldened to attempt first a return to $1,900 levels last seen in January, before a further push to record highs of $2,000 set in August. Mondays breakout in gold came on the back of relatively-calm U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar that further enabled its upward momentum. Yields tied to the was up 0.3% at 1.64%. The , which pits the greenback against the and five other major currencies, was down 0.2% at 90.13. The relative heaviness with Treasury yields \"has done wonders for bullion and that trend should remain intact,\" Moya added. Investing.coms 3-year weekly chart for Comex gold shows the next plausible target at $1,945.70, which will be a peak not seen since the Jan. 6 intraday of $1,966.80. And if gold does not retreat meaningfully after that, it means that $2,000 could be on cue, precisely $2,101.60 -- which comes just slightly beneath the all-time futures high of $2,107.60 set on Aug 7.', 'India has reported 26 potential cases of bleeding and clotting after administration of Covishield vaccine, a government panel investigating adverse events following COVID-19 immunisation has found.The Union Health Ministry said in a statement on Monday that over 23,000 adverse events have been reported since the vaccination drive involving Covishield and Covaxin vaccines started in the country and of these 700 cases were reported to be serious.The National Adverse Event Following Immunisation committee ( AEFI ) has completed an in-depth case review of 498 serious and severe events, of which 26 cases have been reported to be potential thromboembolic (formation of a clot in a blood vessel that might also break loose and carried by the blood stream to plug another vessel) events - following administration of Covishield vaccine - \"with a reporting rate of 0.61 cases/ million doses\".\"There were no potential thromboembolic events reported following administration of Covaxin vaccine,\" the ministry said.As alerts were raised in some countries on post-vaccination \"embolic and thrombotic events\" on March 11 particularly with AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine (Covishield), a decision was taken to conduct an urgent in-depth analysis of the adverse events (AE) in India in the light of global concerns, the ministry said.The National AEFI committee noted that as of April 3, 75,435,381 vaccine doses had been administered (Covishield - 68,650,819; Covaxin - 6,784,562).\"Of these, 65,944,106 were first doses and 9,491,275 second dose. Since the COVID-19 vaccination drive was initiated - more than 23,000 adverse events were reported through the CO-WIN platform reported from 684 of the 753 districts of the country.\"Of these, only 700 cases (@ 9.3 cases /million doses administered) were reported to be serious and severe in nature,\" the statement said.\"The AEFI data in India showed that there is a very miniscule but definitive risk of thromboembolic events. The reporting rate of these events in India is around 0.61/million doses, which is much lower than the 4 cases/million reported by UK\\'s regulator Medical and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA). Germany has reported 10 events per million doses,\" the statement stated.Thromboembolic events keep occurring in general population as background and scientific literature suggests that this risk is almost 70 per cent less in persons of South and South East Asian descent in comparison to those from European descent.The ministry is separately issuing advisories to healthcare workers and vaccine beneficiaries to encourage people to be aware of suspected thromboembolic symptoms occurring within 20 days after receiving any COVID-19 vaccine (particularly Covishield) and report preferably to the health facility where vaccine was administered.The symptoms listed are breathlessness, pain in chest, pain in limbs/pain on pressing limbs or swelling in limbs (arm or calf), multiple, pinhead size red spots or bruising of skin in an area beyond the injection site, persistent abdominal pain with or without vomiting, seizures in the absence of previous history of seizures with or without vomiting, severe and persistent headache with or without vomiting (in the absence of previous history of migraine or chronic headache).The symptoms also include weakness or paralysis of limbs or any particular side or part of the body (including face), persistent vomiting without any obvious reason, blurred vision or pain in eyes or having double vision, change in mental status or having confusion or depressed level of consciousness or any other symptom or health condition which is of concern to the recipient or the family.The ministry said that Covishield continues to have a definite positive benefit risk profile with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths due to COVID-19 across the world and in India.Over 13.4 crore doses of Covishield vaccine have been administered as on 27 April in India.The ministry is continuously monitoring the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines and is promoting reporting of suspected adverse events.', '(Bloomberg) -- Chinese leaders meeting top U.S. officials in Alaska on Thursday will look for evidence that the Biden administration is prepared to take a softer tone toward Beijing despite tough talk in public. Theyre likely to be disappointed. Two months into his term, President Joe Biden is showing that for all his criticism of former President Donald Trump, his team wont make major changes to his predecessors hard-line approach to China. On human rights in Chinas Xinjiang region, on Hong Kongs eroding freedoms and even on tariffs, Trump-era policies remain in place. \"At least initially, theyre sticking with what Trump left them,\" said Aaron Frieberg, a professor of foreign policy at Princeton University and a national security aide under President George W. Bush. \"On concrete things like saying China is committing genocide in Xinjiang -- that was a land mine left for them on the way out the door -- instead of trying to work around it, they just embraced it.\" The meetings in Anchorage, Alaska on Thursday and Friday will bring U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan together with Yang Jiechi, a member of the Communist Partys Politburo, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The talks are expected to be contentious, a chance for both sides to lay out their disagreements in a relationship that has soured markedly in recent years. The encounter will also offer a case study for adversaries and allies alike: On key issues around the world, the Biden teams rhetoric has changed from the Trump era -- emphasizing cooperation with allies and concern for human rights -- but its actual policies arent that different. China is the most prominent example so far, but there are others: On Saudi Arabia, Biden held back from sanctioning Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman even as he went beyond Trump by publicly implicating him in the death of columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Biden is taking up Trumps push to reinvigorate the Quad alliance of the U.S., Australia, Japan and India. Blinken has praised Trumps \"Abraham Accords,\" the rapprochement between Israel and countries in the Middle East. And while Republicans in Congress accuse Biden of weakness, he is sticking to opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany, is refusing to remove sanctions on Iran unless it returns to compliance with the nuclear accord that Trump abandoned and is keeping up a frequent resort to financial sanctions as a tool to express disapproval. Middle-Class First The biggest continuity is the motivation for U.S. policy. Trump called it \"America First.\" For Biden and his advisers, its a foreign policy that responds to the needs of the American middle class. Gone is a vow to spread democracy around the world, or the idea of America as the worlds lone superpower. \"In the same way that Donald Trump came in and wanted people to believe he was making a dramatic departure from Barack Obama, there are elements of consistency and they dont necessarily want to admit to that,\" said Christopher Preble, co-director of the New American Engagement Initiative at the Atlantic Council. \"There is a recognition that if you dont at least gesture toward how U.S. foreign policy delivers benefits to the American people, then youre going to have a problem.\" Bidens supporters -- and Trumps critics -- argue that there have been several major departures: The U.S. has rejoined the World Health Organization and pledged more than $2 billion to a global coronavirus vaccination campaign. It has vowed to restore the Iran nuclear deal and rejoined the Paris climate accord, an area of potential cooperation with China. One legacy of the Alaska meeting would be if the U.S. and China schedule a virtual meeting next month between President Xi Jinping and Biden focusing on climate change. That could happen if the talks in Alaska are viewed as successful, according to people familiar with the situation. Bidens supporters also say its the \"how\" of foreign policy that hes doing differently. Biden has pledged to work with allies, rather than handing them ultimatums. So far, one of the biggest changes has been what Biden hasnt done: no more surprise tweets from the Oval Office, no more sudden swings or erratic decisions. Process is back. \"There will always be some form of continuity, but the change is in how to achieve your objectives,\" said Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a former U.S. ambassador to NATO. \"When it came to Russia or China policy, Trump had a different policy than the rest of his administration and those two were often in conflict and much of the administration spent their time trying to catch up.\" At the same time, the administration has made clear that for all its rhetoric, its going to stick to a pragmatic approach that will often disappoint human rights activists. In addition to keeping the Saudi kingdom as a crucial ally, officials have indicated they intend to maintain a partnership with Egypt, which has long been criticized for ignoring human rights. Theres another way Biden is like Trump: For all his talk about working more closely with allies, hes already shown a willingness to offend them at times. Canada, for example, was unhappy with Bidens decision to cancel permits for the Keystone XL pipeline soon after taking office. And many challenges are ahead. NATO allies still lag in defense spending. Japan and South Korea remain beset by tension. Turkey remains committed to Russias S-400 missile system. North Koreas Kim Jong Un is shunning U.S. entreaties to talk as he continues to expand his nuclear arsenal. \"Theyre still comfortably ensconced in the virtue of their superiority and havent yet had to face the tawdry discontinuities of their approach,\" said said Kori Schake, the director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. \"If it turns out other countries are no more willing to support American priorities under a Biden administration, then it has real-world consequences.\" (c)2021 Bloomberg L.P.', 'on Monday said it has become the first manufacturer in the country to get accreditation from NABL for outdoor regulatory testing. The company has been accredited with ISO/IEC 17025 for the \\'wet grip and coast by noise\\' tyre tests on the track, Apollo Tyres said in a statement.The testing capability is linked to the central government\\'s plan to implement \\'star rating\\' of tyres, in line with the tyre labelling regulation in Europe, it added.\"The new testing capabilities, developed by Apollo Tyres, show a very good level of accuracy and reliability, and the test results are well accepted by European Homologation authorities.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine -- one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show Dr Reddy\\'s is currently scaling up the manufacturing of the drug. The company didn\\'t specify the production volumes. On Monday Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Health and Family Welfare Minister, Dr. Harsh Vardhan jointly launched the new COVID drug 2-DG at DRDO Bhawan in Delhi. The anti-COVID-19 therapeutic application of the drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) has been developed by Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS), a lab of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), along with Dr Reddys Hyderabad. The first batch of the 2-DG sachets were handed over to Director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria and Lt Gen Sunil Kant of Armed Forces Medical Services(AFMS). The government said more will be handed over to different hospitals across the country for emergency use. The drug 2-DG, which comes in powdered form in a sachet, needs to be taken twice a day orally by dissolving in water. The drug is used as an adjunct therapy where it administered along with primary treatment. The clinical trials showed that the drug helps in relatively faster recovery of those who have been hospitalised and also reduces need for supplemental oxygen compared to those who are on standard of care.', '10 Best Books for Investors!

The eliminations are likely to accelerate as the economy reopens following the Covid-19 pandemic and conditions normalize, Wells Fargo analysts led by Mike Mayo said in a note, adding that \"this will be the biggest reduction in U.S. bank headcount in history.\" Banks have little choice but to improve productivity in the face of stiffening competition from fintech, technology and retail firms, he said. Non-banks offering lower-cost products online have steadily chipped away at the businesses of traditional lenders, with efforts intensifying over the past year as the pandemic pushed consumers to digital options. Earlier this year, Walmart (NYSE: ) Inc. lured a pair of senior Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ). bankers to run its fledgling fintech startup -- a move that struck fear on Wall Street. Mainstream lenders have pleaded with regulators to halt efforts by retailers and startups to offer core banking products. \"Technology is impacting banking more than even before,\" Mayo said in an interview. \"For banks, technology is both friend and foe.\" Goliath Winning The moves will ultimately improve productivity as banks become leaner with less layers of management, Mayo said. Thatll enable them to keep up with competitors, in a capital-for-labor swap that leads to 100,000 to 200,000 reductions over the decade. \"Goliath is winning,\" Mayo said. \"The largest banks have more scale to deploy greater amounts of technology to better serve customers while becoming more efficient.\" Branches will likely continue to close, with many shuttered by the pandemic unlikely to reopen. Employment per branch will also probably fall amid more self-service options, Mayo said. While the pandemic increased headcount by about 2% as banks took care of employees and pledged not to eliminate jobs, that short-term trend is likely to reverse, he said. Mayo said that the push for greater efficiency could end up forcing a smaller share of staff to shoulder more of the workload as the distance between the lowest-level employee and top executives shrinks. \"What youre seeing is flatter organizational structures with de-pyramiding, greater scope of responsibility and more expectations that each employee will generate either more revenues or greater efficiency,\" Mayo said.

Cairn filed this suit on Friday in the US District Court for the Southern (NYSE: ) District of New York and claims that Air India is liable in case the Indian government is not willing to pay the $1.2 billion.

The popular Twenty20 tournament was suspended indefinitely earlier this month after several personnel tested positive for COVID-19 amid a devastating second wave of novel coronavirus cases in the country. The pandemic also forced the BCCI to move the 2020 edition of the IPL to the United Arab Emirates where matches were held in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah between September and November. Badale said finding space on the calendar would be the biggest obstacle with India set to host the T20 World Cup in October. \"There is a possibility, a small possibility, that in September there might be something in the UK or possibly something in the Middle East either side of the T20 World Cup but it\\'s going to be a real challenge,\" Badale told reporters. \"In my opinion, the players are already playing too much cricket. The calendars are incredibly packed, particularly this year after COVID.

A Motilal Oswal report says that regional hot-rolled coil (HRC) steel prices have continued to rise and was at Rs 66,750 per tonne at traders' markets on May but was still at a discount of Rs 15,300 per tonne in comparison to the landed cost of imports from Korea. As per a Credit Suisse report, China and FTA (free-trade agreement) export HRC prices rose $50 and $10 per tonne, respectively, in the previous week, while Indian mills saw hikes of up to $60 per tonne. Despite this, domestic steel prices are still at a 15 percent and 11 percent discount to China and FTA imports respectively. Considering that, there is still huge room for domestic prices to go up in the coming months. Also read: China iron ore, steel prices hit record as supply worries prompt speculative buying A big export opportunity Rising steel prices are a global phenomenon. The report says that prices in Europe rose by $20 per tonne to a record $1,185 per tonne, while Chinese domestic prices remained flat as of May 6, 2021. Spreads increased $32 per tonne, $121 per tonne, and $48 per tonne MoM in China, Europe, and India, respectively. China withdrawing from export markets in the medium term is also structurally positive for domestic steel producers. China is to reduce exports from May, as the country has imposed restrictions to support domestic industries. China's new export policy puts Indian steelmakers in a sweet spot as they are poised to benefit from the dual tailwinds. On one hand, steel prices are showing promise to increase further as they are still at a discount. On the other hand, restrictions on Chinese exports will open up markets in the US and Europe, where there are signs of an economic recovery. Domestic market hits a roadblock The steel sector is looking at a strong prospect of increasing exports but weakening domestic sentiments have emerged as a major concern. As per the Motilal Oswal report, India's steel consumption declined 26 percent month-on-month to 6.7 million tonnes in April 2021. It is likely to decrease further in May if the pandemic is not contained in time. Also read: Govt bans supply of oxygen to industries to meet demand from COVID-19 patients Due to weak demand, imports and production have also taken a hit. India steel imports declined 27 percent MoM to 364kt, while crude steel production declined 21 percent MoM to 8 million tonne in April. Amid this, low inventory levels, which are down 39 percent year-on-year to 8.3 million tonnes, remain a silver lining. Lack of oxygen supply has also hit steel production. Currently, the oxygen supply is diverted for medical purposes, leaving little room for industrial supply. As per the steel ministry, oxygen stock at steel plants has reduced to just half a day from 3 1/2  days earlier. Oxygen is crucial in various steel production processes like blast furnaces lancing and gas-cutting. Its shortage has badly hit steel production and the industry would be expecting the issue of supply shortage to be restored immediately to increase production and make the most of the rising international demand.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine -- one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.

Once again theatres are shut due to coronavirus-led lockdown in different states. In a few places, where theatres are allowed to operate with limited capacity, there is no audience due to COVID-19 scare. This is why Tandon said that the first two quarters of FY22 will be a challenge. Challenge continues \"April-May-June is a write-off. July-August-September we will have to see. But starting October there will be string of movies which will be ready to release because by that time vaccination would be over. We have pinned our hopes on the vaccination of the entire country. I have got my second jab and have to be careful for 15-20 days. While I have to be responsible and wear mask, I may not be fearful of going out,\" Tandon told Moneycontrol. While Tandon hopes that after the vaccination drive the fear psychosis will come down and audience will be ready to go to theatres, things will restart for cinemas not before second half of FY22, according to experts. This means that like last year, two quarters for theatres will be a washout, putting more pressure on multiplexes like INOX. \"INOX is shut everywhere as 95 to 98 percent states have asked us to shut. It is only Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh with capacity restrictions. But there also we have shut down because there is nothing to show. There is fear psychosis. So, all our 648 screens are shut.\" With theatres once again facing challenging times, exhibitors like last year will have to think of measures to mitigate cost. One such measure is negotiations with landlords regarding rent waiver. Rent negotiations On this the INOX CEO said, \"(We are) still speaking with them. Some are ready for rent waiver. Others said that let this thing pass and we will discuss it. Developers are saying that we are standing with you.\" During the earnings call, Tandon had noted that expense towards rent and CAM during Q4 FY2020 was Rs 82.7 crore and this dropped to Rs 67.2 crore in Q4 FY21. For the current closures, Tandon said that in lot of places they have got a positive answer even for shutdowns which is voluntary. So, INOX\\'s effort is to replicate the negotiations that happened in the last financial year. The multiplex operator is also deferring screen expansion plans and waiting for the situation to normalise. Expansion plans deferred For FY22, while INOX has plans to add 19-20 screens, to add more 25 screens it will be wait and watch. So, this financial year INOX will move up from 648 screens to 670-odd screens. The multiplex major is focusing on adding around 20 screens because 90 percent of the work is completed and for that it would need CAPEX of around Rs eight to Rs 10 crore. Ask Tandon whether there has been a drop in adding new screens due to COVID-19 impact, he said that there is no construction and we cant carry out our fit-outs because of lockdown. So, it is not the same at all. \"One of our best years was two years back when we had opened 85 screens in one year. Up till March 2021, we opened about 17 screens in five properties. And in this financial year we have opened five screens. So, it is not like we are not expanding only that it has deferred. It stopped because there were national lockdowns and there was no revenue coming in,\" said Tandon. Betting on content and food While challenges are plenty, Tandon is optimistic about theatre business. He said that there were about 20-25 movies in Hindi, English and other Indian languages ready to be released including big ventures like Akshay Kumar\\'s Sooryavanshi, Shahid Kapoor-starrer Jersey, Ajay Devgn\\'s Maidaan. Hence, content is there, he said. Along with content, INOX is betting big on its food and beverage (F&B) business. Tandon said that they want to increase the food segment\\'s contribution which is at 22-25 percent to a higher contribution in the entire revenue pie of INOX. \"Apart from staple cinema food, we are increasing our reach and expanding it to meal options including pulao, dal makhni, rajma chawal. We also have special menu to satiate sweet tooth of our customers with jar based desserts like Tiramisu.\" Tandon said that today in megaplex in Malad, Mumbai, INOX is offering 250 items with 12 different cuisines. In addition, INOX has tied up with online food aggregators Swiggy and Zomato for better reach and especially to cater to non-cinema audience. For INOX, revenue coming from food business in 2020 was Rs 500 crore and Tandon said that they are putting a lot of efforts to increase this.', \"Investing.com - was trading at $1.52406 by 01:10 (19:40 GMT) on the Investing.com Index on Monday, up 10.11% on the day.

            "The rising prices of steel -- which is widely used in sectors like construction, auto, consumer goods, etc -- will not affect the demand in the domestic market,CEO and Managing Director T V Narendran has said.He also said that the current prices of steel in India are higher if compared with rates prevailed a few months back but the same are lower in comparison to the rates in the international markets.\"Yes, prices are higher compared to what they were in the past but lower compared to anywhere in the world. I don't think it should affect demand,\" he told PTI. Narendran made the statement while replying to a question whether surging prices of steel will affect the immediate demand for steel by the Indian consumers.The CEO further said if one takes a look at the prices of hot rolled coil in the US, it is at USD 1,500/ tonne, in Europe it's close to 1,000 euros per tonne. \"So, I think the steel users in India have the best available prices in the world.\"The exporters of steel-intensive products are in a good position as the prices in India give them a chance to be competitive in the global market, he said.In India, steel is trading at an all-time high. In May 2021, the steel makers raised prices of Hot Rolled Coil (HRC) by Rs 4,000 to Rs 67,000 per tonne and Cold Rolled Coil (CRC) by Rs 4,500 to Rs 80,000 per tonne.HRC and CRC are flat steel used in steel-consuming industries such as auto, appliances and construction.The prices of vehicles, consumer goods, and construction cost are bound to be impacted by the rise in steel prices as steel is a raw material for these sectors, an expert said.Meanwhile, last week on Wednesday, country's largest iron ore mineralso hiked the prices of lump ore by Rs 700 to Rs 7,650 a tonne per tonne, and fines by Rs 1,500 to Rs 6,560 per tonne.Iron ore is a key raw material used in steel making. Any change in its prices has a direct impact on the rates of steel.\n",

            "(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer prices climbed in April by the most since 2009, amid a record increase in used-car costs and signaling a build-up in inflationary pressures as burgeoning demand gives companies latitude to pass on higher costs. The consumer price index increased from the prior month after a 0.6% gain in March, according to Labor Department data Wednesday. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core CPI rose from March. The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.2% in the CPI and a 0.3% gain in the core measure. The annual CPI figure surged to , distorted by the comparison to the pandemic-depressed index in April 2020. This phenomenon -- known as the base effect -- will skew the May figure as well, likely muddling the ongoing inflation debate. While Federal Reserve officials and economists acknowledge the temporary boost, its unclear whether a more durable pickup in inflationary pressures is underway against a backdrop of soaring commodities costs, trillions of dollars in government economic stimulus and incipient signs of higher labor costs. The core CPI measure, which was also biased higher by the base effect, rose from 12 months ago. For the last year the annual core inflation metric has held below 2%. Wednesdays report offers insight into bubbling price pressures across parts of the economy. Wages have shown signs of picking up, and supply chain challenges have elongated delivery times and driven materials prices higher. (c)2021 Bloomberg L.P.\n",

            "(Bloomberg) -- After several years weighing the pros and cons of leaving Hong Kong, Ms Lee is taking the plunge and moving to Canada. Though she has no job lined up, faces higher taxes and will have to endure harsh winters for the first time, shes willing to risk it. \"Am I worried about my job prospects in Canada? Of course Im worried,\" said the compliance officer at a major global financial firm who asked that her first name not be used. \"The economy isnt great and firms are freezing headcount. I can say this is probably the worst time to migrate.\" As China strengthens its hold on Hong Kong with a new security law, residents considering an escape are coming to grips with the sacrifices theyll face. With the global economy enmeshed in the worst recession in almost a century, jobs are hard to find and countries are tightening borders. Hard-earned skills, languages and contacts that helped them thrive in the Asian finance hub wont all travel. And preferred destinations like Canada, Australia and the U.K. impose taxes that are three times higher. \"Just because you were successful in Hong Kong doing a certain job doesnt mean that theres going to be an appetite for your skill set or experience in another country,\" said John Mullally, regional director at Robert Walters Plc, who handles financial sector recruitment for Southern (NYSE: ) China and Hong Kong. \"Its probably one of the worst times in our living history to be rocking up in a new country and expecting to land a job.\" The challenges arent deterring people like Lee. Shes already bought a house in Toronto and plans to move in October, foregoing a job paying more than HK$1 million ($130,000) a year. Lee, in her 30s, and her husband first applied for a visa in 2014 as a back-up plan in case things got worse. In her view it has, with the security law becoming the last straw. Lost Optimism \"We have lost any optimism toward the Hong Kong government,\" she said, convinced that the finance hub will become just another Chinese city with curbs on free speech and censored television. \"We dont want to stay here any longer.\" Even with the risks that come with relocation -- especially in the middle of a global pandemic -- recruiters are seeing an uptick in demand. Two years ago, about 80% of job hunters who came to see Mullally were looking for work in Hong Kong. Now about half of them are seeking work abroad, driven by the security measures along with dwindling job prospects in a city embroiled in a deep recession of its own. \"The message they gave me is they just dont feel that Hong Kong for them is long-term the best option from a career and earnings perspective,\" Mullally said. Yet with unemployment rate in Canada at double digits and Australia close to that, emigres like Sam recognize the job search wont be easy. The senior investment banker at a global firm is moving with his wife and two kids to Australia in three months. Sam spent his teens in Australia, but has been in Hong Kong for 20 years, developing contacts that launched his banking career. He declined to reveal his salary, though investment bankers in Hong Kong are typically awarded bonuses that are 50% higher than in Sydney, Mullally said. Senior private bankers meanwhile earn about 30% more in Hong Kong than in Australia, said Rick Chung, a Hong Kong-based recruiter for banking and finance at Randstad NV who is seeing about 10 to 15 finance people a week looking for jobs abroad. Sam, 43, will have to start from scratch in Australia, and may have to switch careers. With the top marginal income tax rate of about 45% -- versus 15% in Hong Kong -- hell also have less money to spend. \"I left Australia many, many years ago and I dont have any corporate contacts there so itd be hard for me to stay in investment banking,\" said Sam, who didnt want his last name published. \"Taxes are so much higher in Australia so I dont think I will be able to earn as much.\" A mid-level mergers and acquisitions banker named Leung is also considering a move -- to London. Leung, 38, worked there for five years before coming back to Hong Kong a decade ago. Like Sam, hes looking for a better place to raise his three-year-old son. Leung doesnt hold U.K. citizenship but has a British National Overseas passport granted to Hong Kong residents before the colony was handed back to China in 1997. Leung has no job lined up in London, where bankers typically earn about 15% more than in Hong Kong, but also pay triple the taxes. While housing in Hong Kong is among the most expensive in the world, London isnt far behind. \"I dont mind giving up what we have in Hong Kong to trade for a better future for my son,\" said Leung, adding the hardest part will be leaving his parents behind. \"I dont mind starting all over again.\" Staying Put Another investment banker at a U.S. firm named Tang spent his teen years in Canada and has a passport allowing him to eventually retire there. For now, the 50-year-old prefers to stay put with his three kids for another few years. \"I have to say Hong Kong is still the financial center where bankers make the most take-home salary,\" Tang said. Lee meanwhile, is getting ready to head to Toronto in a few weeks, after winning a bidding war to buy a house in the citys west end. Many friends may follow suit she says, while another colleague at her firm just quit to decamp to the U.K. \"So many around me are plotting to leave Hong Kong,\" she said. \"Honestly, who isnt?\" (c)2020 Bloomberg L.P.\n",

            "(Bloomberg) -- Rising cases of the India variant of coronavirus could force the U.K. government to delay plans to end the pandemic lockdown, officials fear. The number of confirmed infections of the strain more than doubled in the past week to 1,313 from 520, according to Public Health England. While theres no evidence the India variant can evade vaccines, there are signs that it spreads more easily than the Kent mutation which ran rampant in the U.K. at the start of the year, prompting a third national lockdown. The government expects to press ahead with the next phase of easing restrictions on Monday, which will bring the return of international leisure travel, and the reopening of pubs and restaurants indoors. But officials are studying the data on infections, and the final stage of the \"roadmap\" for ending the lockdown and social-distancing rules -- due on June 21 -- is now in doubt, people familiar with the matter said. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government will need to see positive data on infections and new variants for the plan to go ahead next month. 'Cycle of Infection \"We have got to break the cycle of infection, because one of those big tests was infection rates have to be suppressed, and the other big test is variants,\" Zahawi told LBC radio. \"If those cause a problem, then the tests will fail.\" Still, ministers are more likely to back a targeted surge in the vaccination program in areas where the India variant is more prevalent, rather than order local lockdowns, people familiar with the matter said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson would face resistance from within his ruling Conservative Party to any slowdown in lifting the lockdown. On Thursday, he said he is \"anxious\" about the spread of the India variant. He is due to hold a press conference later Friday. Data from the Office of National Statistics released Friday showed another drop in infection rates, with now just one in 1,340 people in England estimated to be carrying Covid-19 in the week to May 8.

            "Five of six Indian companies that have entered into manufacturing arrangements with sovereign fund Russian Direct Investment Fund ( RDIF ) for Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V may seek a waiver of conducting local Phase-3 clinical trials One of the six, Hetero Biopharma , had last fortnight obtained clearance from the subject expert committee under Indias drug controller to conduct Phase-3 trials of the Russia-developed vaccine in India.Sauri Gudlavalleti, head of research and development at Dr Reddys Laboratories, which has secured rights to distribute Sputnik V and obtained emergency authorisation in India, said the other five may approach the Indian regulator shortly seeking the exemption.\"It is a technology transfer and not a redevelopment,\" said Sauri, citing that as a reason to seek the waiver. He was responding to media queries on the sidelines of a programme on Monday to announce Dr Reddys arrangement withfor administering the vaccine in 35 Indian cities.Dr Reddys is initially importing Sputnik V and has priced it at Rs 995.40 a dose inclusive of GST. Apollo will charge Rs 1,250 a dose, including the vaccine administration cost.On Hetero Biopharma seeking to conduct Phase-3 trials, Sauri said: \"That is one approach that has been taken. But we will have to see depending on the regulatory approach and pathway to be taken by the rest.\"Dr Reddys expects the other five players to approach the regulator in the next few weeks seeking the exemption, he said.He said local trial production of Sputnik V was expected by late June or early July, to be submitted to the regulator for analysis and testing on the quality to check if it was on par with the imported vaccine.Sputnik V was developed by Russias Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology with the backing of RDIF and was registered by the Russian health ministry as the worlds first Covid-19 vaccine based on the human adenoviral vector platform.RDIF had entered into arrangements with Indian pharmaceutical firms Hetero Biopharma, Gland Pharma , Virchow Biotech, Panacea Biotech, Shilpa Medicare and Stelis Biopharma to produce the vaccine here.Dr Reddys has conducted Phase-2 trials on 100 people in India where it proved safety and absence of adverse events and equivalence of immunogenicity. Subsequently, the Hyderabad-headquartered generic drug firm initiated Phase-3 trials on 1,500 additional volunteers to study the immunogenic response.\"Based on the 42-day immunogenic response, we were given approval for the vaccine,\" said Sauri, adding: \"The trial is continued for the full period of 183 days where we study the relative efficacy, the full extent of the trial.\"Dr Reddys \"would intend to approach the Indian regulator in the next few weeks\" for the single-dose Sputnik V Light to be launched in India, he said, adding: \"We are awaiting all the additional submission requirements and data sets from Russia.\"\n",

Because this wave has come for the second time, and there is nothing definite about this. We have to take steps with full caution,\" he said at the event in DRDO headquarters.Singh said the government has taken the overall situation seriously, whether it is the matter of oxygen supply or ensuring ICU beds or the arrangement of cryogenic tankers for transportation of liquid oxygen.\"I am happy to say that the Medical Corps has also decided to take back its retired doctors so that our health system can be strengthened further. I heartily commend such physicians who are joining this campaign even after their service,\" Singh said.The defence minister also listed efforts of the armed forces in helping civilian authorities deal with the situation across the country.However, he asserted that deployment of the armed forces for Covid-relief measures has not impacted their operational preparedness at the borders.\"Even after going through all these difficulties, we have ensured that our preparedness at the border does not have any impact. There is no shortage of enthusiasm and enthusiasm of our forces anywhere. We know this very well, no matter how big the difficulty is, we will overcome it,\" he said.The Defence Ministry on May 8 said that the clinical trials of the drug 2-DG showed that it helps in faster recovery of hospitalised patients and reduces supplemental oxygen dependence.The approval of the drug has come at a time India has been grappling with a record-breaking wave of coronavirus pandemic that has stretched the country's healthcare infrastructure to its limit. The anti-COVID-19 therapeutic application of 2-DG drug has been developed by the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS), a leading laboratory of DRDO, in collaboration with Dr Reddy's Laboratories (DRL) in Hyderabad.The drug comes in powder form in sachet and is taken orally by dissolving it in water, the ministry said.In efficacy trends, the ministry said, patients treated with 2-DG showed faster symptomatic cure than the standard of care (SoC) on various endpoints.\n",

Systematic Investment Plan (SIPs) inflows were at Rs 8,590 crore in April compared to Rs 9,182 crore in the previous month. \"The net inflows into equity funds have continued in April, which is very encouraging. Flows slowed down a bit compared to March largely because of the disruption caused by the second wave of the pandemic. However, the SIP numbers have remained robust and the addition of SIP folios also have been very healthy,\" said G Pradeepkumar, CEO at Union AMC. He expects flows to pick up once the pandemic is brought under control through increased vaccination and other measures.

            "(Bloomberg) -- Senator Marco Rubio has proposed an amendment to a broad package of legislation to counter China that aims to shield research and development boosted by a massive infusion of cash from threats of espionage or theft. The change being sought by the Florida Republican to a package of bills based on a proposal from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Indiana Republican Senator Todd Young offers a preview of the sort of skirmishing that is likely to erupt as Schumer pushes for floor passage of the legislation by the end of the month. Rubios amendment would expand oversight of research funds to include the U.S. intelligence community, requiring the Director of National Intelligence and other agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation to certify that anyone receiving money authorized by the legislation is not susceptible to foreign threats. It also would prohibit people who have received financial or other support from the Chinese government from receiving funds authorized by the legislation, among other provisions. Rubio wants to add his proposals to the Endless Frontier Act, the legislation from Schumer and Young that is forming the backbone of a broader package that will receive floor consideration this week. An initial procedural vote is scheduled Monday afternoon. The main part of the bill would authorize more than $100 billion over five years to boost research and development of innovative technology and manufacturing at colleges, universities and other institutions and create a new entity within the National Science Foundation to focus on technology. Its also expected to include a $50 billion emergency appropriation aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing, as well as funding for a communications security initiative designed to counter Chinas dominance of 5G networks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The package is being pushed toward passage on an aggressive timetable by Schumer. The fervor among Democrats and Republicans to counter about Chinas challenge to U.S. economic primacy has made the legislation, known as the Endless Frontiers Act, one of the few bills to draw broad support at time when partisan divisions are running deep. Its fate also may serve as an indicator for other proposals, such as infrastructure, that have nominal bipartisan support. \"Federal underinvestment in sciences has seen our country slip, exposing critical weak spots in our economy,\" Schumer said last week, setting up the first vote on the legislation. \"If we dont fix them, we will no longer be the number one economic leader in the world.\" Related to that goal is a separate proposal expected to be included that would provide $50 billion for a program aimed at increasing semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. that was passed as part of the 2021 defense bill but never funded. The proposal has gained urgency as a global shortage of semiconductors causes economic pain in the U.S., shutting down auto plants because of a lack of chips for cars and trucks. Semiconductor Supplies Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas has been working on the proposal with Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona along with others and said he expects it will supported by the White House as well as Senate Republicans. President Joe Biden in his broader infrastructure proposal has called for as much as $50 billion to expand U.S. chipmaking. \"If China decided to cut off our supply of semiconductors it would be like the Strait of Hormuz is to oil,\" Cornyn said. \"It would be a disaster economically.\" Despite generally broad support, the Endless Frontier Act was the subject of a sometimes contentious markup session in the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday. Scores of amendments were proposed and some were adopted, sometimes over the protest of co-sponsor Young. In particular, he called an amendment proposed by Democratic Senator Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, a \"poison pill\" because it would divert some of the funding to the Department of Energy for its network of national laboratories. Among those is the Los Alamos National Laboratory (NYSE: ) in New Mexico. Funding Shift \"I am disappointed that an amendment was adopted to divert significant funding away from the NSF Tech Directorate in favor of a program outside of the Committees jurisdiction,\" Young said in a statement after the bill was approved by the committee. The legislation has been carved up into separate tranches, with about half of the money going to the core functions of the National Science Foundation and another almost $30 billion going to help stand up a new tech directorate within the agency. Lujans amendment sends about $17 billion to the national labs. His co-sponsors included GOP Senators Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and John Thune of South Dakota, all of whom represent states where the national labs have a presence. Lujans amendment passed 23 to 5 and the overall bill passed the Commerce Committee by 24-4. Rubio had also called on the Senate floor for the legislation to be directed to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency -- or DARPA -- instead of the National Science Foundation, calling the NSF \"the same agency that time and again has had the research we fund stolen by professors and graduate students who are on the payroll for China.\" Other Republicans, including those on the House Republican Study Committee, Congress largest ideological caucus, said the legislation did not have sufficient protections built into it and called for boosting defense spending rather than spend money on research and development. Such political horse-trading -- along with a bipartisan desire to confront China -- may be key to passage in the Senate. The Endless Frontier Act, which is supported by numerous industry and trade groups, will be combined with a bill passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this year and with proposals from other Senate committees, including Banking and Health Education and Labor. Senators will also be able to offer amendments on the floor. The process for passing the overall package is estimated to take two weeks. (c)2021 Bloomberg L.P.\n",

(Representative image: Sputnik V) live bse live nse live Volume Todays L/H More x Dr Reddy's on May 17 said 8-9 states have approached the company for procurement of Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine. The company named Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, among the states that have reached out to them. Dr Reddy's had announced that the imported doses of Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine have been priced at Rs 948 plus 5 percent GST or Rs 995.40 per dose. It said the price of the imported Sputnik V vaccine would remain the same for the government and private channels. The company would be working with hospitals in metros that can handle -18 degrees Centigrade storage for the vaccines.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine -- one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show Ramana said Dr Reddy's is trying to secure more doses from RDIF. The company has a commitment from RDIF to get 250 million doses of Sputnik V first and second dose. About 15-20 percent of the initial supplies will be imported from Russia. Dr Reddy's said once the local manufactures begin supplying, which is expected in the next two to three months, the vaccine prices will come down. \"They have to absorb the technology from RDIF, have to get approvals from the regulators and then scale up manufacturing,\" said Sauri Gudlavalleti - Head Of Research And Development. \"We are working with the regulator to bring appropriate guidance, on whether the other Indian suppliers with whom RDIF signed supply agreement will have to do clinical trials or not,\" Gudlavalleti added. Hetero that has a tie-up with RDIF has got permission from DCGI to conduct Phase-3 trials of Sputnik V vaccine. Gudlavalleti said the company intends to reach out to the Indian drug regulator in the next few weeks seeking emergency use authorisation of Sputnik Light single-dose vaccine. Apollo Hospitals tie-up Dr Reddy's on Monday announced a partnership with Apollo Hospitals to do the trial rollout of the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine in India. Dr Reddy's will use the services of the Apollo Hospitals network nationally in storage, transportation, administering and monitoring of people who get vaccinated. Apollo Hospitals will be pricing the Sputnik V vaccine at Rs 1,200- Rs 1,250 per dose.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine -- one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.

It also holds gas condensates of about 5,000 barrels per billion cubic feet of gas.The buyback contract signed on Monday envisages daily production of 28 million cubic meters of sour gas over five years, Shana said.ONGC Videsh Ltd ( OVL ), the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had in 2008 discovered a giant gas field in the Farsi offshore exploration block.OVL and its partners had offered to invest up to USD 11 billion for the development of the discovery, which was later named Farzad-B.After sitting over OVL's proposal for years, on October 18, 2020, NIOC had informed OVL of its intention to conclude the contract for Farzad-B development with an Iranian company, in an apparent rejection of the Indian firm's bid.The 3,500 square kilometer Farsi block sits in a water depth of 20-90 metres on the Iranian side of the Persian Gulf.OVL, with 40 per cent operatorship interest, signed the Exploration Service Contract (ESC) for the block on December 25, 2002. Other partners included Indian Oil Corp (IOC) with 40 per cent stake and Oil India holding the remaining 20 per cent stake.OVL discovered gas in the block, which was declared commercially viable by NIOC, on August 18, 2008. The exploration phase of the ESC expired on June 24, 2009.The firm submitted a Master Development Plan (MDP) of Farzad-B gas field in April 2011 to Iranian Offshore Oil Company (IOOC), the then designated authority by NIOC for the development of Farzad-B gas field.A Development Service Contract (DSC) of the Farzad-B gas field was negotiated till November 2012, but could not be finalized due to difficult terms and international sanctions on Iran.In April 2015, negotiations restarted with Iranian authorities to develop the Farzad-B gas field under a new Iran Petroleum Contract (IPC). This time, NIOC introduced Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC) as its representative for negotiations.From April 2016, both sides negotiated to develop the Farzad-B gas field under an integrated contract covering upstream and downstream, including monetization/marketing of the processed gas. However, negotiations remained inconclusive.Meanwhile, on the basis of new studies, a revised Provisional Master Development Plan (PMDP) was submitted to POGC in March 2017, sources said, adding that in April 2019, NIOC proposed development of the gas field under the DSC and offtake of raw gas by NIOC at landfall point.However, due to the imposition of US sanctions on Iran in November 2018, technical studies could not be concluded which is a precursor for commercial negotiations.The Indian consortium has so far invested around USD 400 million in the block.\n",

            "(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Bidens $1.9 trillion package will sail through the House when it takes up the bill on Tuesday, according to Democratic lawmakers and aides, even after proposals progressives championed were scaled back. The Senates changes to the House-passed bill, made to appease moderates and comply with parliamentary rules, are unlikely to prove enough to make progressive Democrats vote against it. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can only afford to have four Democrats oppose a bill for it to pass, if all members are voting and Republicans are lined up in opposition, given her partys thin majority. Two Democrats joined a united GOP in voting against the initial version of the stimulus. Pelosi on Sunday predicted the bill will pass. \"In two days, the House will have a resounding, hopefully bipartisan, vote for justice,\" Pelosi said in a letter to her caucus on Sunday. \"We can then send it to the president and move quickly to distribute its life-saving resources.\" Other senior lawmakers agreed. \"I dont think there is any trouble. What Democrat is going to vote against a bill that cuts poverty by a third, expands child tax credits and SNAP, gives $1,400 to 80% of their constituents?\" said Budget Chairman John Yarmuth, a chief architect of the American Rescue Plan bill. SNAP refers to a federal food-assistance program. With Biden now cruising to his first legislative victory less than two months after proposing his relief bill, economists have baked its effects into their forecasts for a stronger recovery in 2021. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ). economists see the unemployment rate tumbling to 4.3% by year-end, from 6.2% in February, with employment climbing by almost 7.4 million for 2021, making up most of the 9.4 million plunge in payrolls last year. \"Growth will be rip-roaring during the coming year,\" Moodys (NYSE: ) Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi wrote Sunday, due to additional fiscal stimulus, the end of the pandemic and consumers emerging from lockdown. The outsize stimulus has propelled a surge in bond yields, with 10-year rates punching through to the highest levels in more than a year last week. Deadline Nears Democratic aides said the looming March 14 expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits makes for a strong disincentive for any rank-and-file members to try to force a renegotiation with the Senate. That could risk missing the deadline, with assistance lapsing. Progressives who had expressed concern about any changes in the Senate so far are holding their fire, with the Congressional Progressive (NYSE: ) Caucus issuing a statement calling the upper chambers changes \"minor.\" Outside groups, like the Justice Democrats and Sunrise movement, were also quiet on the bill over the weekend. The Senate reduced weekly supplemental unemployment benefit to $300 per week through Sept. 6, compared with $400 through August in the House bill. The new version also now lets individuals earning up to $150,000 to collect $10,200 in benefits tax free. Senates Tweaks While the ceiling for zeroing out stimulus checks was lowered to $80,000 from $100,000 by the Senate, the bill now made student-loan relief tax-free. A progressive attempt to add a phased-in $15 minimum wage to the package failed when eight senators in the Democratic caucus voted Friday against waiving budget rules to allow it in the bill. Marathon negotiations Friday night showcased the delicate balance of power in the Senate, and the sway of moderates. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer contended with a move by West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin to back a GOP proposal to phase out the enhanced jobless benefits by mid-July. With Schumer arguing that such a change could cause trouble in the House, Manchin ultimately compromised, and backed the deal to keep aid going until September. Progressive House Democrats are already turning their attention to getting their proposals in a second budget reconciliation bill -- which allows for Senate approval by a simple majority, rather than the usual 60 votes to cut off debate. Congress is expected to take up the next reconciliation bill before the August recess.

Talking to reporters ahead of his meeting with the experts on mucormycosis, known as black fungus, which is emerging as a new threat to those who recover from COVID- 19, Sudhakar said he had a video conference with Bharat Biotech founder Dr Krishna Ella , his daughter Dr Jala Ella and rest of the team.\"Dr Ella has assured me that their facility at Malur in Kolar will be able to produce one crore vaccines by June- end. By July-end it will be by two to three crores, and their target by August-end is four crore to five crore vaccine doses,\" Sudhakar said.According to him, Krishna Ella and all the directors assured him that they will give vaccines to Karnataka at the earliest.The minister said he asked them to provide a roll-out schedule as well, which they will do soon.Karnataka officials will be in touch with them on how to roll out the vaccine in the state in the coming days.\"Our priority is to get the vaccines to the people of our state at the earliest,\" Sudhakar said.He also said that Bharat Biotech's facility in Hyderabad can produce one crore doses of COVID vaccine a month whereas the Karnataka unit will roll out four to five crore doses a month from August onwards.To a question, Sudhakar said Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa would be holding a meeting in the evening where a detailed discussion will take place on the extension of lockdown following which a decision will be taken.Replying to a query on the Congress questioning the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for allegedly selling the vaccines, Sudhakar said it was donated by the Centre to the COVID affected nations on humanitarian grounds as no one foresaw the severity of the second wave.He said it was highly regrettable that the Congress was indulging in politics despite assuring the government that it will cooperate with it in the fight against COVID.Karnataka has so far conducted 1.12 crore inoculations of coronavirus vaccines in the state comprising first and second doses whereas it has suspended the vaccination of people between the age group of 18 and 44, who are about 3.5 crore, due to shortage of vaccines.The state is battered by the second wave of COVID infections and reported 31,531 infections and 403 deaths on Sunday.There are over six lakh active cases in the state, a majority of whom are in Bengaluru.\n",

We expect L&T to witness Core E&C revenue/EBITDA/adjusted PAT CAGR of 12%/11%/17% over FY21-23E. Our estimates largely account for commodity price inflation risk. Our consolidated revenue/EBITDA/adjusted PAT CAGR estimate stands at 14%/17%/28% over FY21-23E, helped by lower losses in the Hyderabad Metro. Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,604 We believe that L&T is well-placed to emerge stronger given its financial, technical and managerial capability for sustaining and gaining market share. Given the strong tender pipeline and healthy order book, we have revised our earnings upwards for FY22E/23E by 4.5%/5.8%. Target price is revised upwards owing to revision in earnings and target market capital of its holdings companies. Dolat Capital | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,718 Our FY23E EPS estimates remain unchanged, while we cut our FY22e EPS estimates by 7% to factor in the impact of restricted business activities especially in H1FY22 due to the lockdown. ICICI Direct | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,700 L&T reported decent order inflows while execution improved amid onsite productivity and supply chain normalisation leading to better margins. Also, better collections improved the working capital situation while cash proceeds from E&A have provided much-needed liquidity comfort and the ability to further repay the debt. We expect L&T to deliver standalone revenue CAGR of 12%, EBITDA CAGR of 11.8% and PAT CAGR of 15.1% in FY21-23E. Sharekhan | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,795 L&Ts strong operational performance along with healthy guidance related to execution, order intake and working capital requirement for FY2022 are key positives emerging out of Q4FY2021 results. The international outlook looks promising for developed economies as they seem to recover faster from the COVID-19 pandemic, while GCC countries are expected to pick up investments with oil staying above USD 60. Bernstein | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 1,708 The Q4 was respectable with strong cash flows & improved margins, still guidance of mid-teens growth for orders & revenues. The message of significant optimism & control over the business will please the markets. Goldman Sachs | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 2,000 It was a strong performance with optimistic commentary. All indicate strong discipline & focus on profitability, while stars are aligning for the next leg of capex uptick in India. Nomura | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,654 It was a strong delivery on core margins/cash flows. The sales rebounded sharply in FY22. The near-term EBITDA margin is susceptible to rising commodity prices. Nomura cut FY22 profit by 2% on near-term execution headwind in Q1FY22. The strong order book & higher services will drive growth into FY23, it said. Kotak Institutional Equities | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,850 The stage is set for the company to deliver high-teens profit CAGR over FY20-23. We do not expect hiccups along the way given the strength of the backlog. JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 1,815 The execution headwinds to be transient. The commodities are not proving to be an unmanageable concern. JPMorgan cut the FY22/23 EPS estimate by 3/4%. The focus on recycling balance sheet & achieving 18% RoE are the key positives. Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Raised to Rs 1,816 The guidance will be a discussion point but its delivered in far tougher fiscal.

            "(Bloomberg) -- House Democrats on Monday released the first draft text for key pieces of legislation that will comprise President Joe Bidens Covid-19 relief bill. The legislative language released by the Education and Labor Committee and Committee on Financial Services shows Democrats are forging ahead with plans to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, and have earmarked $15 billion for airline-worker payroll assistance. These and 10 other committees are meeting in the coming days to assemble the stimulus bill for a House floor vote the week of Feb. 22. Once the bill goes to the Senate, it is designed to be passed with just 50 members plus the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris using a special budget fast-track procedure. House Democrats are showing with Mondays bill text that they will try to increase the minimum wage despite a raging debate over whether Senate rules permit them to do so through the so-called reconciliation procedure. Education and Labor Chair Bobby Scotts draft bill includes the wage increase, which also phases out the lower wage for tipped workers. The committee, set to meet Tuesday to hold votes on the bill, estimates 27 million workers will see a pay increase under the provision by 2025. The draft bill also has $130 billion for kindergarten through 12th grade school reopening and $40 billion for higher-education institutions. Childcare businesses would benefit from $39 billion in funding. The bill would extend pandemic food benefits using $5 billion and expand home heating assistance by $4 billion. Provisions to tighten workplace safety standards for Covid-19 are also included, as is funding to subsidize health insurance for the newly unemployed. Senior-care services would receive $1.4 billion, and money is set aside to combat a rise in domestic violence and child abuse that have come with the pandemic and lockdowns. Homeowner Aid The Financial Services Committee is charged, under the terms of the 2021 budget adopted last week by Congress, with drafting legislation totaling $75 billion in deficit increases. Chair Maxine Waters (NYSE: ) will convene the panel on Wednesday to vote on this portion of the bill. According the committees draft legislation, that will include $10 billion to use the Defense Production Act to produce masks and other Covid-19 equipment, $25 billion for rental assistance, and $5 billion in assistance for the homeless. The bulk of the rental aid program would run through the Treasury Department. Homeowners would benefit from $10 billion for direct assistance with mortgage payments, property tax payments and utility costs. For airlines, $14 billion in payroll assistance would be provided directly to airlines and $1 billion to contractors. The House Ways and Means Committee is planning for a multi-day process to approve the tax portions of the stimulus bill, starting on Wednesday. That text includes another round of relief checks, paid-leave benefits and expanded tax credits for families with children and low-income individuals. It also addresses the extended unemployment benefits that Biden called for in his overall $1.9 trillion proposal. (c)2021 Bloomberg L.P.\n",

            "May 14 (Reuters) - New Zealand batsman Devon Conway hopes sprinkling kitty litter on practice wickets might help him prepare for India's spin bowlers ahead of the ICC World Test Championship final. Conway has been selected for New Zealand's tour of England, which starts with a two-test series against Joe Root's side followed by the inaugural Test Championship final against India in Southampton from June 18. The 29-year-old lefthander, who will bid to make his test debut on the tour, hopes playing the ball off kitty litter might help prepare for the variation of spin off bowlers' foot-marks. \"Basically the idea is to get the ball to sort of spit out of the rough,\" Conway told New Zealand broadcaster Spark Sport after throwing some kitty litter on a pitch. \"It's a bit harder to play, but good practice ... It's about finding a gameplan to combat that and just practice how you're going to play in the game. \"When it does roughen up and the ball does spit and turn a lot, it's all about being positive.\" New Zealand play the first test against England in London on June 2.\n",

The most recent example is COVID-19, which was first detected in Wuhan, China.

            "(Recasts, adds details from fighters, local legislator) May 14 (Reuters) - Myanmar army artillery shelled positions held by civilian militias in a northwestern town for a second day on Friday, rebel fighters and a lawmaker said, after the ruling junta declared martial law there to quell a local rebellion against its rule. The junta said martial law was imposed in Mindat in Chin State late on Thursday after whom it called \"armed terrorists\" attacked a police station and a bank. The attacks posed a further challenge to the military as it struggles to restore order in the country amid widespread anger over its coup in February which ousted the elected civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The resistance has expanded in recent weeks from daily street protests and strikes to attacks on junta-appointed administrators and ambushes of security forces by civilians. The newly-formed Chinland Defence Forces on Friday said it was behind the fighting in Mindat. It ambushed a convoy of military reinforcements on Friday, according to one fighter and a local legislator. \"Fighting is still ongoing and Tatmadaw is firing into Mindat town using artillery,\" said the lawmaker, referring to the military by its local name. He requested that he remain anonymous. \"This is the most serious fighting.\" The Chin rebels numbered about 400-500, who between them had about 30-40 assault rifles, plus traditional hunting rifles, he said. \"But they are not trained well,\" he said, adding most had only a week-long training session. A spokesman for the Chinland Defence Force declined to provide details on the fighting, citing security reasons. LOSING CONTROL \"They (the junta) can no longer rule the city except in some areas where they have bases. They have no control in the rural areas,\" the spokesman said. One of its fighters told Reuters six trucks were seized and many weapons taken. A military spokesman did not answer calls from Reuters. The state-run Myanmar News Agency said the fighting on Wednesday and Thursday in Mindat involved 100 people who attacked a police station and about 50 targeting the state-run Myanmar Economic Bank. Security forces had repelled the attack without suffering casualties, it said. The Chin lawmaker said the fighting erupted after the military refused to release seven local youths wrongly detained by authorities. He said five local militia fighters had been killed. News website Irrawaddy said two had died, citing one of the fighters. Pro-democracy groups and ethnic minority armies have been rallying behind a National Unity Government (NUG) that is seeking domestic and international support to undermine the military as prevent it from consolidating power. The NUG earlier this month announced the formation of a People's Defence Force, to protect civilians from the military. Some fighters have sought training with insurgents that have battled the Tatmadaw for decades in border regions. So far, 788 people have been killed in the military's crackdown according to an advocacy group. The military, which disputes that number, imposes tight restrictions on media, information and the internet. Reuters cannot independently verify arrests and casualty numbers. In a sign of the continued defiance, pictures and video on social media showed demonstrators marching in the commercial capital Yangon on Friday chanting \"we believe that we gonna win, we must win, we must win\". Others carried signs saying \"coup must fail\".\n",

            "Moody's Investors Service on Monday said if the second wave of the pandemic does not decline to more manageable levels and results in a prolonged and wider lockdowns, it will have a more severe effect on companies' earnings recovery. It said the resurgence of coronavirus infections in India that has led to regional lockdowns will put the brakes on rated companies' earnings recovery seen in recent months. Earnings have seen a rising trend since October 2020 following the easing of national and state-level lockdowns. But renewed restrictions in many states will weaken demand for goods and services, and disrupt the recent recovery trajectory. \"India's largely regional and less stringent lockdowns amid the second wave of coronavirus cases so far have had a limited impact on economic activity. If infections fail to decline to more manageable levels, however, lockdowns may be prolonged and widen, which will have a more severe effect on companies' earnings recovery,\" Moody's said in a report. It expects the negative impact on economic activity to be limited to June quarter, and that the economy will rebound in the second half of the year. However, if infections fail to decline to more manageable levels, lockdowns may be prolonged and increase in scope. This situation would severely weaken rated companies' earnings and derail the recovery seen over the last six months, it added. \"Another nationwide lockdown would have severe disruptions for the whole country, compared with the more contained, state-level restrictions in effect now. A national lockdown scenario would restrict personal mobility on a large scale, lower demand for goods and services, as well as lead to supply-chain disruptions and aggravate labour shortages,\" Moody's said. Widespread movement restrictions will lower demand for transportation fuel and reduce the capacity utilization for oil refiners. Similarly, demand will decline in sectors such as automobiles and real estate as consumers postpone their purchases amid limitations on movement. Lower domestic demand in end-user industries will also reduce capacity utilization for heavy industries like steel, cement, and metals and mining. Long and widespread lockdowns, if imposed, would dampen consumer sentiment and weaken demand for goods and services in general. Consumers will likely defer nonessential purchases, which will lower economic activity in the country. \"A scenario of stringent lockdowns would result in blue-collared workers moving back to their hometowns and manufacturing activity likely coming to a halt. This situation would lead to labour shortages once lockdowns are eased and manufacturing activity resumes. \"As a result, capacity utilization would remain weak even in the immediate weeks and months after lockdowns are eased,\" Moody's added.\n",

            "Santosh Joseph, founder and managing partner, Germinate Investor Services LLP said that a combination of factors, such as global lucrativeness and huge retail and domestic flows, are keeping the market from falling a lot. Many fear a March-April 2020 like situation of selling out and losing out. Therefore, the market is extremely nimble and delicate trying to be ahead of the curve. Aggressive lockdown, vaccinations and drop in new Covid cases, supported by growth recovery should revive the markets in 1-2 quarters, he added. Edited Excerpts:- Q: The second COVID-19 wave disrupted a lot of sectors and there are some sectors which have not seen major impact. Which sectors should one consider for the portfolio and why? Yes. Covid has been a serious disrupter, mover and shaker. Market dynamics and sectoral contributions have changed. From the initial flight to safety in defensives, sell-off in financials, to now major action in mid/small caps across sectors is seen. It's normal to see that FMCG, pharma and IT hold the fort while many discretionary sectors like entertainment, travel and financials take a hit. I personally believe that though you can spot inflection points of sectoral changes, a balanced approach of having many sectors with appropriate weight is still the best way to navigate these markets. For example, the much ignored metals sprung a surprise and many missed it or are joining the party quite late. Always better to be diversified than adventurous, unless you have a strong reason otherwise. Q: The market has been volatile after seeing more than 5 percent correction from record high levels. Do you think the volatility will subside in the coming weeks? The second wave progression is the primary reason for this volatility. I think the market didn't expect such a nasty outcome, especially since the larger part of 2020 was well-managed relative to the global scenario. It's only fair that there is a consolidation, probably on the lower side due to curfews, lockdowns in various state to curb the rising number of cases and casualties. Aggressive lockdown, vaccinations and drop in numbers supported by recovery of growth should revive the markets in 1 or 2 quarters. Q: Brokerages and rating agencies lowered their GDP growth estimates for FY22 due to disruption by the second COVID wave. What is your take? This is tricky to call! And will keep updating largely based on COVID impact. Rather than chase the macro economic headline number, I guess it is better to focus on individual portfolios and use this opportunity to streamline or rejig the portfolio. Q: What should be the investor's strategy in the current circumstances, with respect to portfolio? Is it still a buy on decline market? I guess this depends on the point of the investor's journey. For someone who hasn't started, this is a great market to begin and for others, like I said earlier, it's time to streamline or rejig. Market will be at its best, being volatile on both sides, giving opportunities to enter and exit. Q: India witnessed record additions of Covid cases on daily basis. But the market has not seen a proportionate fall. What are those supporting factors for the market? We have a combination of global lucrativeness and huge retail and domestic flows that are keeping these markets sideways. Many are thinking 3 months to 6 months ahead. Hoping the cases will drop and markets will recover. Many fear a March-April 2020 situation of selling out and losing out. Therefore, the market is extremely nimble and delicate trying to be ahead of the curve. Q: Any of the rules state by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger that one should follow right now? I think the biggest takeaways are discipline in their process of investing and making the most of the given opportunity. They are not afraid to not buy and when they buy, they take huge positions. : The views and investment tips expressed by investment expert on Moneycontrol.com are his own and not that of the website or its management.

            "FII selling is one of the primary reasons for the recent consolidation in the market, especially Nifty, where FIIs have large holdings in some of the major constituents, said Jyoti Roy, DVP - equity strategist, Angel Broking. In an interview to Moneycontrol's Kshitij Anand, Roy said Nifty should find support near levels of 14,400 while last week's high of 14,967 will act as a resistance. Edited excerpts: Q) Bears took control of D-Street last week even as the government assured a supply of 2 billion jabs. What led to the price action on D-Street in the week gone by? A) Correction in markets last week was on account of global volatility led by sell-off in tech shares. Moreover, concerns also remained over the trajectory of the second coronavirus wave in India. While there was a clear peak in new cases due to lockdowns in the week gone by, markets are looking for a clear signal as to when state governments will start opening up the economy given that daily new Covid cases still remain significantly high. Q) Small & Midcaps remained resilient in the fall seen in the week gone by. What is fuelling the optimism in the broader market space? A) FII selling is one of the primary reasons for the recent consolidation in the market, especially Nifty, where FIIs have large holdings in some of the major constituents. Mid & small cap indices have held up much better than the Nifty given the lower FII shareholdings and greater interest by domestic institutions and retail investors. Q) What are the important levels to watch out for? And, what should be the strategy as Nifty closes below 50-Days SMA for the week ended May 14? A) While the Nifty may have closed below the 50-day slow moving average during the week, we would not read too much into it. We believe that this week is very crucial for the markets as we have started to see a sharp decline in new daily Covid cases in India. In case we see the trend continuing then there could be some positive price action, especially if global markets remain supportive. On the downside, Nifty should find support near levels of 14,400 while last week's high of 14,967 will act as a resistance level. Any break above last week's highs will indicate that the consolidation is over for the markets. However, a break below levels of 14,400 could see the Nifty retest its previous swing low of 14,150. Q) Sectorally, Utilities rose nearly 5%. What led to the price action? A) Utilities had a good run during the week led by PSU stocks like GAIL, NTPC, PTC and Power Grid as there was significant value buying in PSU stocks. Moreover, a few of the stocks like Adani Transmission also contributed to the rally in the sector. Q) IT index was the top sectoral loser - down over a percent. Can it be attributed to profit booking? A) The sell-off in the IT sector can be attributed to profit booking due to sell-off in global tech stocks, along with premium valuations relative to historical averages. The IT sector has been on a dream run since the beginning of the Covid crisis given faster adoption of digital technologies which has led to an increase in medium term growth potential for the sector thus leading to significant rerating in multiples. We believe that the correction in the sector is going to be short-lived and we continue to maintain our positive outlook due to strong medium-term growth potential. Q) FIIs remain net sellers in Indian markets. What is spooking foreign investors - is it domestic or global factors? A) FII selling in Indian equities can be largely attributed to the second Covid wave in India. The intensity of the second wave has caught all market participants by surprise and FIIs will wait for clear indication that the worst of the Covid wave is behind us before we see a reversal in the outflows. Global volatility led by a sell-off in the Nasdaq also contributed to volatility in the past week.\n",

            "(Bloomberg) -- Mario Draghi agreed to take over as Italys next prime minister, naming his ministers as he prepares to head a new government that will prioritize the pandemic, a struggling economy and moving ahead with European integration. Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, picked the Bank of Italys Daniele Franco as finance minister, and confirmed a Bloomberg News report that Roberto Cingolani, an executive at Leonardo SpA, would head a new ministry for ecological transition. He will be responsible for managing spending on green projects under the European Unions recovery package. Draghi reported back to President Sergio Mattarella Friday evening after two rounds of talks with political leaders. After securing broad support from all the countrys main parties except for the far-right Brothers of Italy, he told the head of state he was ready to form an administration. This is a government \"with a clear European and Atlantist profile,\" said Francesco Clementi, a professor of comparative public law at Perugia University. \"The ministers list shows a great awareness of the technical difficulty of governing in these difficult times, but also of the political perils that brings together very different parties.\" The former governor of the European Central Bank kept Luigi Di Maio as foreign minister, with the new administration set on carving out a bigger role for Italy alongside partners Angela Merkel of Germany and Frances Emmanuel Macron. Draghi has already told lawmakers he will push for a common euro-area budget, and Italy has taken up the rotating presidency of the Group of 20 nations. On the new governments agenda: a pandemic thats claimed more than 90,000 lives in Italy, the worst recession since World War II, and a debt load at almost 160% of output. The cabinet, with several political appointees, reflects Draghis attempt to ensure support from rival forces. Franco, director-general at the central bank, will play a key role in administering Italys 209 billion-euro share ($253 billion) of the EUs recovery package, and in introducing measures to help families and businesses cope with the recession prompted by the pandemic and lockdowns. Other key ministers include Giancarlo Giorgetti, minister for economic development. A veteran senior lawmaker with the League of Matteo Salvini, he has been pushing for the party to adopt a more pro-European stance.

            "(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. is poised to ban Huawei Technologies Co. from its next generation mobile networks under a two-step plan designed to protect critical communication systems from potential security threats, a person familiar with the matter said. Under the blueprint, British phone companies will not be able to add any new Huawei components to their 5G networks by the end of the year. After that, all existing equipment made by the Shenzhen-based company would need to be removed from 5G networks by 2027, the person said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, his senior ministers and top security chiefs are due to be presented with the proposal at a meeting of the National Security Council on Tuesday, with an announcement expected later in the House of Commons. U.S. War on Huawei Begins to Turn After Europes Rough Year If the plan is agreed at that meeting , it would mark a major reversal by Johnson, and risk escalating tensions between the U.K. and China at a highly sensitive time. Johnson gave the green light to Huaweis involvement in emerging mobile networks in January, subject to limits, but he came under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to change course. Recent additional U.S. sanctions on the company have changed the calculus in London. In May the U.S. banned Huawei from sourcing microchips which use American technology, a move that forced British officials to reassess their view of the security and sustainability of using the companys equipment in 5G networks. The prevalence of chips that are made with or incorporate U.S. technology caused New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu to declare in May that \"Huawei has 12 months left to live.\" At the same time, Johnson has faced demands from within his own Conservative Party to take a tougher line with Beijing. Senior Tories demanded the premier should give firm deadlines for when Huawei will be blocked from Britain, amid concerns its equipment could be used by Chinese spies -- a charge the company denies.

            "* Some countries have authorised shots for children * WHO chief says India of huge concern * Ease rules on mask wearing with caution: WHO (Adds detail throughout) GENEVA, May 14 (Reuters) - The World Health Organization urged rich countries on Friday to reconsider plans to vaccinate children and instead donate COVID-19 shots to the COVAX scheme that shares them with poorer nations. The WHO is hoping more countries will follow France and Sweden in donating shots to COVAX after inoculating their priority populations to help address a gulf in vaccination rates. Canada and the United States are among countries that have authorised vaccines for use in adolescents in recent weeks. However, a WHO official said talks with Washington on sharing doses were under way. understand why some countries want to vaccinate their children and adolescents, but right now I urge them to reconsider and to instead donate vaccines to #COVAX,\" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual meeting in Geneva. COVAX, which has delivered around 60 million doses so far, has struggled to meet supply targets partly because of Indian export restrictions on the AstraZeneca vaccine due to its growing epidemic. So far, around 1.26 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally. Tedros also said the second year of the pandemic was set to be more deadly than the first, with India a huge concern. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sounded the alarm over the rapid spread of the coronavirus through India's vast countryside on Friday, as the country's official tally of infections crossed 24 million and over 4,000 people died for the third straight day. More than 160.71 million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally and nearly 3.5 million have died, according to a Reuters tally. Infections have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019. WHO officials urged caution in lifting measures that contain transmission, such as mask wearing, and warned that more variants were bound to be detected. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised that fully vaccinated people did not need to wear masks outdoors and could avoid wearing them indoors in most places. few countries are at the point where they can drop these measures,\" said Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan.\n",

            "Non-banking finance companies ( NBFCs ) have managed to survive the first wave Covid inflicted slow down but given the persistence of infections, the full effects of the lockdown and suspension of business on their asset quality will only be known gradually, Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) said in its monthly bulletin.Among sectors NBFCs lend to, industrial sector, particularly micro and small and large industries, were the hardest hit by the pandemic as they posted decline in credit growth.However, NBFCs in the retail loan sector stayed ahead of the curve aided by their relatively low delinquency.Incremental credit flows to the retail sector continued to grow in the second and third quarter of fiscal 2021 led by vehicle loans, gold loans, transport and tourism.\"Players in the retail segment stayed above the curve by gauging the public sentiments and playing to their strengths. With the persistence of the pandemic and the need for observing social distancing norms, passenger vehicles sales increased by 13.6 per cent in December 20207. It is mirrored in the disbursal of vehicle loans by NBFCs, as these loans grew by 10.7 per cent in Q3:2020-21. Loans against gold also grew robustly as it filled in the cash requirements and possible working capital requirements of small firms. However, incremental credit to industries declined in the same period as the sector is yet to shake off the impact of the pandemic,\" RBI said.NBFC profitability had dropped in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to the Covid induced lockdown, however, the situation improved marginally in the second quarter. NBFCs return in assets (RoAs) and return on equity (RoE) improved from 1.8% and 10.3% respectively in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to 2.3% and 12.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.Asset quality of NBFCs also witnessed an improvement in 2020-21 due to regulatory forbearance on declaring of NPAs. Both gross as well as net NPA ratios fell in the third quarter if fiscal 2021 compared to the previous year.RBI however acknowledged that the true extent of NPAs in the sector may be gauged in the upcoming quarters as the interim order by the Supreme Court on asset classification standstill was lifted in March 2021.Overall though consolidated balance sheet of NBFCs grew at a slower pace in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2021 due to challenges due to Covid and lower demand for loans, NBFCs continued to disburse credit despite the disruptions.\"The retail sector benefitted from incremental credit disbursed by the sector, aided by their low GNPA ratios and by staying tuned to customer preferences. The profitability of the NBFCs improved in Q2:2020-21 compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year on account of steeper fall in expenditure than in income,\" RBI said while admitting that the future of the sector will now depend on how it copes with the second wave of Covid.\n",

            "(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic hurt American financial well being, but the impact differed widely by education, income and race, a Federal Reserve survey showed. \"The pandemic caused substantial disruptions to many peoples finances, as well as to their daily lives, even while public-policy responses appear to have muted many of the effects,\" the Fed said in its 2020 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking released Monday. \"A clear pattern from the survey is that financial challenges in 2020 were uneven, and frequently left those who entered the year with fewer resources further behind.\" Almost 25% of adults in the U.S. were worse off financially than the previous year -- the highest since the survey began asking the question in 2014. That compared with 14% in 2019, the survey showed. Those with a bachelors degree, high earners and White Americans were less likely to be impacted by the economic crisis than those with a high-school education or less, low-income individuals and Americans of color. While 75% of all adults reported they were \"doing OK\" by November, only 45% of those without a high-school degree said so, compared with 89% of those with a bachelors degree. Some 80% of White Americans and 84% of Asian Americans reported doing OK financially, compared with 64% each of Black and Hispanic Americans. Financial hardships caused by the pandemic were counterbalanced by financial-relief and stimulus measures, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. But, by November 2020, financial well-being based on these measures had edged back down, the survey showed. Laid Off Last year, 14% of Americans were laid off. Of workers aged 25 to 54 without a bachelors degree, 20% were laid off, compared with 12% of those with at least a bachelors. More than 20% of Black and Hispanic workers lost jobs, compared with 14% of White workers. More Americans saw their income increase than decrease last year, driven by gains for top earners. Almost 30% of adults with at least a bachelors degree saw an increase in their bank account balance after paying bills, compared with 16% who saw a decline. Some 6% of those with less than a high school degree saw an increase, compared with 25% of those who saw a decline in their balance. Working parents reported problems with child care and work as the pandemic shut down many schools to in-person learning. Almost 75% of parents with school-age children said their childs school was partly or completely online. Some 11% of mothers and 6% of fathers said they werent working due to child-care or in-person schooling disruptions, meaning a drop of almost 2 percentage points in the number of adults working overall. Black, Hispanic, single and low-income mothers were more likely to be impacted by child-care and schooling disruptions. Some 36% of Black mothers and 30% of Hispanic mothers said they werent working or were working less because of these gaps. (c)2021 Bloomberg L.P.\n",

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine -- one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.

The first phase of the programme will kick off with vaccinations in Hyderabad on Monday and in Visakhapatnam on Tuesday (May 18) at Apollo facilities.The vaccinations would follow the SOPs as recommended by the government including registration on CoWIN.Hospitals' Joint Managing Director Sangita Reddy said the healthcare major would receive 10 lakh doses of the COVID-19 vaccine over a period of one month.\"Delighted to share @HospitalsApollo has Ptnr with @drreddys 2 admin #SputnikV the 1st foreign-made #vaccine to be used in #India to all DRL staff.

            "For the second consecutive year, sales of air conditioners (ACs) and refrigerators have been hit during the peak season of April and May due to the localised lockdowns and restrictions on account of surging Covid cases in the country. The pandemic situation has forced companies to recalibrate their target and go for pre-Covid (2019) sales number without being too aspirational.Leading players in the segment including, Panasonic and Haier reported almost 75 per cent dip in April sales this year when compared with the same month of 2019 performance. Moreover, May 2021 has been a complete washout so far for them.On top of the present situation, consumer sentiment has been further hit amid reports that there may be a third wave of the pandemic, which further dampens chances of a recovery in sales of compressor-based cooling products such as ACs, refrigerators etc, as people are preferring to keep expenses on hold till the time Covid situation improves.Leading AC maker Voltas said it was expecting a double-digit growth this fiscal but now the second wave and subsequent restrictions have led to a recalibration of targets.\"Initially while budgeting, we had a lot of aspirations to grow more than double digits - but now due to the first quarter getting washed out, our endeavour will be to catch up with last year,\" Voltas MD and CEO Pradeep Bakshi told .Expressing similar views, Daikin Airconditioning India MD & CEO Kanwal Jeet Jawa said: \"If we are able to achieve what we have done in 2019, that would be good enough.\"Last year, April was washed out and May was just 10 per cent (of May 2019) and June was less than 25 per cent of (June 2019 sales).Sales in April this year were 80 per cent of those clocked in the corresponding month of 2019 as only first 15 days of the month were good in terms of activities. May is looking like a complete washout and June could be 75 per cent of 2019, Jawa said.Panasonic India and South Asia President and CEO Manish Sharma said the sale of AC started in March on a positive note, but due to the sudden surge in the number of cases in the second wave and most of the states imposing partial lockdowns, summer sales are being hit.\"We are keeping a close watch on the situation but, we may see a loss of over 50 per cent against sales projections during the ongoing quarter (April-June). We have inventories in stock to ensure a smooth purchase experience for our partners and consumers across offline and online channels,\" he said.Normally, the April-June quarter, as mercury rises in the peak summer, contributes around 30 to 35 per cent to overall sales of ACs and other compressors based cooling products.According to the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA), the entire month of May, which is a period for peak sales of cooling products, would be almost a washout for the industry, as only 15 per cent of the market is open and footfalls at stores are negligible.\"I am looking at the trend\", which is similar to that of last year, said CEAMA President Kamal Nandi.According to Haier Appliance India President Eric Braganza, the only hope is these lockdowns and curfews are restricted till June but the problem is that by the end of that the season would be over.\"This is a crucial month and if you lose it, then you can not make up,\" he said adding that in AC segment, there would be no growth and it would be like last year. \"We were expecting this year to be better than 2019 but again it would like 2020.\"However, companies such as Blue Star are still hopeful and are expecting double-digit growth despite these obstacles.Given the poor penetration level of the category, sales should pick from June onwards helped by factors such as pent-up demand and work-from-home, etc.\"My estimate is 10 to 15 per cent growth for the year,\" said Blue Star Managing Director B Thiagarajan.Bakshi said Voltas will try its best to catch up in the next few quarters.\"In terms of matching up to our performance in last to last year (2019-2020), it is too early to say right now as it depends on several factors. If the summer season is longer, humid, harsher and continues till July, maybe we will be able to match those numbers,\" he said.However, CEAMA president Nandi warns about a possible hike in prices for residential ACs on account of continued inflationary pressure on inputs.\"Industry has to take the balance hike of 20 per cent, they have already increased 12 per cent so far and has to take the rest 8 per cent. A hike will happen as things become normal. This whole impact of the price increase and disturbance and disruption would have a challenge in the second quarter also,\" said Nandi.Unlike last year, when the market picked up in July and August, this year people are talking of the third wave, Haier's Braganza cautioned.\"Last year after the pandemic people were not scared. This year, the mental frame of people is going to be different. People are going to save money anticipating the third wave as people have to incur money on the medical bill. I do not think that the market would respond the way it had done last year,\" he said.The Indian residential AC market is estimated to be around 7 to 7.5 million units per annum and over 15 companies compete in the segment.\n",

            "By Amlan Chakraborty and Sudipto Ganguly NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, May 13 (Reuters) - For someone who lost a season to a nagging elbow injury that needed surgery, Indian javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra understandably welcomed the postponement of the Tokyo Games last year. The mop-haired former world junior champion, potentially independent India's first track-and-field Olympic medallist, had hoped to use the extra time to get back to full fitness and try to find his best form. Instead, the 23-year-old was soon sent scurrying back indoors as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world's second-most populous nation, then surged again in a devastating second wave this year. Chopra is one of 90-odd Tokyo-bound Indian athletes who have spent much of the last 12 months agonising over the loss of precious practice time in an Olympic year. \"There's been an extended period of over two years since I competed in an international competition,\" the javelin thrower recently told Reuters. \"As an athlete, there's only so much one can train and the lack of competition is definitely a factor that's been playing on my mind.\" India leads the world in the daily average number of new deaths reported, accounting for one in every three deaths reported worldwide each day, according to a Reuters tally. was hoping to train and compete in Turkey this month but the Athletics Federation of India suspended their camp after being told the athletes would have to complete two weeks of hard quarantine on arrival. The frustration for aspirant Olympians has been palpable and athletes like table tennis player Sathiyan Gnanasekaran have been forced to innovate to stay sharp during the lengthy lockdowns. Left with no practice partner last year, the tech-savvy paddler used a ping pong robot he had imported from Germany and finally booked his Tokyo spot in March. \"It can fire around 120 balls per minute. It's basically like a feeder one but you can add a lot of randomness into it,\" the 28-year-old told Reuters by telephone. \"You can set up the ball trajectory and frequency, you can set up the spin and speed, you can set up like one ball close to the net, and then the other one at the far end of the table. \"So this is very close to what we practise with a coach or with a fellow player.\" ROBOT V HUMAN Sathiyan has since turned the roof terrace of his Chennai home into a sports hall, ordered a new table just like the ones he will play on in Tokyo, and roped in a local player to practise against. \"Definitely robots can't be compared to humans. I prefer sparring with humans any day,\" he said. \"You miss that human touch. You miss those moments, like seeing openings and placing them in the right place.\" Elsewhere in Chennai, fencer Bhavani Devi faced the same challenge last year when her qualification hopes appeared hanging by a thread in the absence of a sparring partner. The 27-year-old came up with a concrete plan -- literally -- piling bricks and slabs together under a kitbag with a fencing mask attached to it to create a dummy partner. \"It was not a new idea for me,\" the sabre fencer told a virtual news conference on Wednesday, recalling the early days of her fencing career when she could not afford a proper sword and practised with bamboo sticks. \"I used to mount my mask on the wall and do my partner-training those days. It came from that. \"It gave me the feel of fencing with an opponent,\" said Devi, who earlier this year became the first Indian fencer to qualify for an Olympics, booking her spot at the World Cup in Hungary. Boxer Vikas Krishan roped in his family to help, teaching his father to hold the punching bag at his Bhiwani home. \"Having competed at two Olympics, I know what it takes to succeed at the highest level and I am not allowing anything to come in my way,\" the 29-year-old welterweight told Reuters. \"My only aim for Tokyo is to win for India and I have focused all my efforts and energy to achieving that target.\" (Editing by Nick Mulvenney and Peter Rutherford)\n",

            "Consumer goods firm Godrej & Boyce is looking at double-digit growth in its healthcare business going forward, and after the pandemic started in March 2020, it has witnessed a sustained rising demand of its key healthcare products and solutions, said a top company official.Besides, Godrej & Boyce, part of over USD 4.1-billion Godrej Group and a leading maker of medical refrigerators in India, is also quite open to alliance with any vaccine makers such as Pfizer's, that needs to be kept in (-) 70 degrees Celsius.The company's healthcare businesses are growing in the range of 22-25 per cent in the past year, said Godrej & Boyce Executive Director Nyrika Holkar.Godrej & Boyce is operating in the healthcare sector through its multiple step-down subsidiaries, which include Godrej Appliances, Godrej Interio and Godrej Lawkim, in areas such as hospital beds, medical refrigerators and calibration services for medical equipment like ventilators.\"We believe that the healthcare sector present opportunities for y-o-y double-digit growth for the foreseeable future. India's need to bolster and expand its healthcare infrastructure is urgent and compelling,\" Holkar told .Since March 2020, when the pandemic started, it has witnessed \"sustained rising demand\" for many of its key healthcare products and solutions.\"Currently, the healthcare sector's revenues contribute less than 10 per cent of Godrej & Boyce's total revenues. However, we believe that this sector presents strong growth opportunities even after the pandemic ebbs,\" she added.Godrej & Boyce has not shared its revenue from its healthcare sector business.The company is sensing great opportunity by the government plan to strengthen the medical cold supply chain.\"Take, for example, the need to strengthen our medical cold supply chain. While vaccine fridges are the immediate need, the government has also announced plans to create 65 new blood banks at the district level,\" Holkar said.Such precise cooling solutions are also critical for organ storage banks and pharma cold chains including testing labs, she added.\"With Godrej & Boyce's technology and engineering capabilities as well as a range of suitable products, we plan to play a significant role in these areas,\" she added.On being asked as to whether Godrej & Boyce is open to working with COVID-19 vaccine makers such as Pfizer, Holkar said, \"As an organisation, we believe in strong partnerships and collaborations.\"The company, in partnership with the UK-based The Sure Chill Company, sells medical refrigerators that use the properties of water to keep vaccines in the desired temperature range.\"Now, as procurement of vaccinations has been opened up for private sector corporations and hospitals, we are also looking at partnerships and collaborations in this regard,\" she added.When asked about the local value addition of the products sold into the healthcare sector, Holkar said, \"Around 90 per cent of the products that Godrej & Boyce sells in the healthcare sector are through local value addition.\"\"As an organisation, we are committed to a self-reliant India. Keeping that in mind, we are constantly working towards increasing this ratio through local manufacturing, sourcing and collaborations,\" she added.Last year, for instance, Godrej & Boyce has invested 10 per cent of its healthcare revenues back into the business.\"At Godrej & Boyce, investment is a continuous process and we are continuously scanning the horizon to scout for investment opportunities for our businesses,\" she said.In the past 14 months, it has built a new manufacturing plant for Godrej Interio at Khalapur, Maharashtra , with a production capacity of 300 hospital beds per day among other healthcare accessories.\"Similarly, in FY20, Godrej Appliances increased its manufacturing capacity by 300 per cent by making investments in foaming plugs, jigs and conveyor lines. Even at component levels, multiple tools were developed to match plant production capacity,\" said Holkar.Godrej & Boyce also exports its medical refrigerators to over 36 countries covering Africa, the Middle East and SAARC and will continue to focus on these regions.However, currently, most of its healthcare products and solutions are focused towards the Indian healthcare industry.\"Even after the COVID-19 era, there is an immense potential to further upgrade the healthcare infrastructure in order to bolster India's immunisation drive. Having said that, the international markets too offer significant opportunity,\" she said.Holkar also said, \"Going forward, we see an opportunity to step up our exports even further.\"\n",

            "With Cairn Energy dragging Air India assets to the legal battle with India on the retrospective tax issue, legal experts indicate that India is the least favourite in winning the legal war with the company and the option before the country is to go for an out-of-court settlement or to win the appeal filed against the order. The battle between the government of India and Cairn Energy in the retrospective tax issue has taken a fresh twist last week with the latter filing a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York, seeking to make Air India liable for the judgement that was awarded to Cairn. The move to sue Air India is to enforce a $1.2 billion arbitration award that it won against India in a tax dispute case. According to legal experts, the only legal option before India is to succeed in the appeal filed in Hague, although the chances are very less. Where India is standing legally? In December, a Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague had ruled that the Indian government should pay damages worth $1.2 billion to the company and a case of retrospective tax was wrongly applied on Cairn. The court had ruled that the claim by the Indian government was \"in breach of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment\". Later, India opted to appeal against the judgement. Since the arbitration process kicked off, the UK-based company was looking for Indian assets abroad for enforcing the award. This included Air India, oil and gas assets, cash held by state-run banks abroad and also Indian ships. The award was given based on an investment treaty arbitration administered by the Permeant Court of Arbitration (PCA) with a finding of unfair and unequal treatment, expropriation by the government of India by way of retrospective tax legislation. \"Cairn Energy has every right to enforce the award globally against the assets of GoI, as per the New York Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Awards. Air India being a state-owned company, would be treated as an asset of the government of India,\" said S Ravi Shankar, senior partner, Law Senate, a New Delhi-based arbitration firm. Shankar added that if the Court attaches Air Indias assets situated in the US, they may auction them and pay the proceeds to Cairn. \"The only legal option is to succeed in the appeal filed, although the chances are very less,\" he said. Although the GoI has challenged the arbitration award in The Hague, it is pending, and there is no direction barring Cairn from enforcing the award. \"On the face of it, the lawsuit does not seem to be misconceived, although, as I understand, the carrier hasnt received any notice to date. This lawsuit has global repercussions for the GoI as this may trigger multiple enforcement actions around the world against assets of the government of India. The case could serve as a means for Cairn to seize Air India aircraft that land on US soil and other assets,\" said Mohit Goel, Partner, Sim And San. Is there precedence? Earlier this year, a Malaysian court allowed the seizure of a Pakistan International Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft that landed in Kuala Lumpur after Dublin-based AerCap had filed suit in a British court over unpaid dues. The jet was released nearly two weeks later after the two sides reached an amicable settlement. In 2019, a Jet Airways aircraft was seized by Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) in Schiphol over unpaid fees. Similarly, in 2019, the battle between ConocoPhillips and Venezuela too had grabbed headlines. ConocoPhillips had approached the US courts to seize Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA's assets to collect $2 billion compensation it had won in an arbitration against Venezuelas 2007 takeover of its assets. PDVSA had to pay the full amount later ConocoPhillips. Based on previous experiences, experts indicate that the Cairn Energy arbitration has a strong legal standing. \"A combined reading of the New York Convention, the existing UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty, and international law clarifies that the arbitral award has a solid legal standing. The issue of enforcement of the said award seems to be dicey. It could result in a setback in its disinvestment process as the government of India had recently invited financial bids,\" said Krusch Antony, Partner - Arbitration, King Stubb & Kasiva.\n",

            "* Epidemic kills 4,000 for third day running * Spreading fast through rural communities, Modi warns * PM under pressure to impose national lockdown * India's Eid festivities generally subdued -TV (Adds Eid, Lancet, comments on lockdown, testing) By Tanvi Mehta and Shilpa Jamkhandikar NEW DELHI, May 14 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi sounded the alarm over the rapid spread of COVID-19 through India's vast countryside on Friday, as 4,000 people died from the virus for the third straight day and total infections crossed 24 million. India is in the grip of the highly transmissible B.1.617 variant of the coronavirus, first detected there and now appearing across the globe. Modi said his government was \"on a war footing\" to try to contain it. \"The outbreak is reaching rural areas with great speed,\" he said, addressing farmers in a virtual conference. \"I want to once again warn all ... those who live in villages about corona.\" Although about two-thirds of Indians live in rural towns and villages where healthcare facilities are limited, it was the first time Modi has specifically referred to the virus's spread through the countryside since a second wave erupted in February. \"All departments of the government, all resources, our armed forces, our scientists, everyone is working day and night to counter COVID, together,\" he said. Eid festivities celebrated by India's around 200 million Muslims to mark the end of Ramadan were generally subdued on Friday. Most states have imposed full or partial lockdowns and many mosques were either shut or following social distancing measures during prayers. \"The good thing is that everyone is following and celebrating Eid inside their homes,\" Maulana Khalid Rashid, a cleric in the city of Lucknow, told ANI news agency, a partner of Reuters. Television has broadcast images of families weeping over the dead in rural hospitals or camping in wards to tend the sick, while bodies have washed up in the Ganges as crematoriums are overwhelmed and wood for funeral pyres is in short supply. Medical journal The Lancet said restrictions on movement along with international support measures were urgently needed to stem \"an unprecedented public health crisis\". Modi has been under pressure to impose a national lockdown, though on Thursday the president of the Public Health Foundation of India questioned whether that would be effective in India. \"We recognise... the anxieties that are displayed by international observers... but you can't wrap all of India into one blanket,\" K. Srinath Reddy told a panel discussion. Health ministry data recorded 4,000 deaths and 343,144 new infections over the last 24 hours, below last week's peak of 414,188. Total infections since the pandemic struck India more than a year ago crossed 24 million, with 262,317 dead. Experts say the true figures are much higher, with a lack of access to tests and treatment meaning many cases go uncounted. Modi has faced criticism over his leadership during the pandemic, having allowed a huge Hindu gathering to take place in northern India in February and addressed political rallies in April, blamed for spreading the virus to rural areas. FAST-SPREADING VARIANT The fast-spreading variant first found in India has caused alarm around the globe. It has led to big outbreaks in neighbouring states such as Nepal, and has also been detected far afield in Britain, the Americas and elsewhere in Asia. Yamini Mishra, Asia-Pacific director of rights group Amnesty International, said the virus was \"spreading and transcending borders at a frightening speed\" and would hit the region's most marginalized populations hardest. The catastrophe unfolding in India and Nepal should also be a warning to other countries the region \"to invest heavily in surge capacity for an emergency response,\" she said. Modi allowed all Indian adults to request vaccines from May 1. But while India is the world's largest vaccine producer, the huge demand has left it low on stocks and vaccinations have slowed down. As of Friday, it had fully vaccinated just over 39.4 million people, or around 2.9% of the population. The government has promised to accelerate the vaccine programme dramatically in coming months. More than 2 billion doses of vaccine are likely to be available between August and December, government adviser V.K. Paul told reporters. Those would include 750 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine, which is made by Serum Institute of India, as well as 550 million of Covaxin, developed by domestic producer Bharat Biotech.

            "(Bloomberg) -- The Senate voted 51-50, after Vice President Kamala Harris broke her first tie, to adopt a budget blueprint for President Joe Bidens $1.9 trillion virus relief package -- following nearly 15 hours of wading through amendments from both parties. The House had already adopted its budget resolution but will likely have to vote again Friday to agree on the Senates language. Once thats done, Democrats will be able to craft a relief bill in the coming weeks that can pass without any Republican votes under special budget rules -- though the White House, moderates like Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and others still say they want a bipartisan final product. Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders said adoption means help is on the way to those suffering from an \"economic collapse.\" \"Tonight we can say to them we understand the pain that they are experiencing and we are going to do something about it,\" Sanders said. House and Senate committees would have until Feb. 16 to write the stimulus legislation under the instructions in the budget. The final action early Friday followed an all-night marathon of votes on amendments known as a vote-a-rama. Most of the non-binding measures were intended more to make points on hot-button issues like taxes, abortion, immigration and schools that had little or sometimes nothing to do with pandemic aid. There were 41 roll call votes during the process. Democrats mostly held together to beat back the Republican amendments, but on several issues centrist Democrats displayed their clout in the 50-50 Senate and delivered a message to Biden and progressives that they wont get everything on their wish list. \"This was a giant first step,\" Majority Leader Charles Schumer said, noting the vote came exactly one month after two new Democrats were elected in Georgia, handing the majority to his party. Democrats did have a series of defections on energy-related amendments, though none supported a proposal aimed at barring a federal carbon tax. That amendment, offered by Republican John Hoeven of North Dakota, failed on a 50-50 vote. Seven Democrats voted to oppose a ban on fracking and two opposed Bidens decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline -- potential warning signs as Democrats prepare a package on climate change legislation. The Senate agreed to amendments against a near-term increase in the minimum wage during the pandemic and against stimulus checks for \"upper income\" individuals. While non-binding, these could prefigure a delay in the wage phase in or a tighter cap in who gets checks. The latter amendment, a bipartisan proposal from Manchin and Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, sought to prevent upper-income people from receiving government stimulus payments. They argued it didnt make sense for $1,400 checks to go to wealthier families, though their amendment didnt specify a particular income level. It passed 99-1, with only Kentucky Republican Rand Paul in opposition. The adoption of the budget, assured by the presence of Harris, marked the clearest sign yet of the of the Democratic takeover of the Senate, even if its by the slimmest margin. No Republican has yet backed anything close to the $1.9 trillion sought by Biden, with many in the GOP pivoting to austerity politics as they did in 2009 with a Democrat sitting in the Oval Office. Republicans complained Biden was taking a partisan stance while spurning a $600 billion offer from 10 of their senators. Democrats held firm against efforts to tie school funding to reopening schools, arguing the whole point of the money is to help schools safely reopen in the first 100 days of Bidens presidency. The non-binding amendments can set the stage for follow-on action -- or campaign ads against senators in future elections. One immigration amendment by Ted Cruz split the GOP, with 60 senators blocking his proposal opposing an expansion of work-related visas until the economy fully recovers. That could signal a slim possibility of reaching a bipartisan immigration deal later this year -- a major Biden priority. Just before final adoption, the Senate stripped out three amendments -- on the Keystone pipeline, fracking and banning stimulus checks for undocumented immigrants. Those measures could have caused the budget to lose votes in the House. Lawmakers clustered in tight groups on the Senate floor as they talked and debated policy. It was a scene reminiscent of last years impeachment trial of then-President Donald Trump and one that foreshadowed his second trial, set to begin in less than a week. The pandemic that has continued to rage around the country seemed an afterthought but for the masks that all but one of 100 senators wore. The exception was Paul. Some of the senators on the floor were experiencing their first vote-a-rama after taking office this year: Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Marshall of Kentucky, Alex Padilla of California, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of Georgia. Democrats are already planning another budget reconciliation package later this year for other items, including on climate legislation.

            "These three pointers will help improve the relationship between Sales and Marketing This is a perennial issue in small and medium businesses. Are sales and marketing different or the same? Should it be different functions or the same? Do companies mean sales when they say marketing? I am not going to discuss the fundamental differences between these two functions here. I will only say that sales and marketing are two sides of the same coin. You need both, as marketings role is different from sales and it is important to maintain a healthy relationship between the two. What is the relationship in your company between marketing and sales? How do sales folks rate their relationship with marketers? Bringing alignment between sales and marketing is one of the biggest challenges faced by most SMEs today - especially in the B2B sector. If done right, the benefits are many: Effective marketing planning, lead generation, conversion, and overall results of sales and marketing. Together, they can do many powerful things within the company, commanding better delivery from production, supply chain and other support functions. When companies examine the drivers to operational efficiency and profitability, they find that a key issue is defining shared processes in sales and marketing. The way content is generated in collaboration with sales and how marketing takes responsibilities for lead generation are important in driving better harmony in the relationship between sales and marketing. The best of the B2B organisations we have worked with in the past have shown some interesting best practices, which could be of big use to others. For instance, in the best of the companies, more than 46 percent of the sales leads forecasted are generated by marketing as compared to the industry average of 21 percent. Where sales and marketing have been in sync, companies have grown double the industry average. Best in class companies also ensure that sales and marketing have regular meetings every week, at least 50 percent more than the other companies. These companies have demonstrated the regular coordination between the two functions by deliberately constituting joint working groups for special projects such as key account management or a new marketing campaign. Such organisations also take the performance of marketing functions seriously in that an individual or team will be made responsible. More importantly, these companies share such performance details of campaign success and failures with the key stakeholders. Wherever sales and marketing have performed in sync, there were common templates and data sheets for each to share and collaborate on. They have also built in whitepapers, case studies and CRM data for seamless use between the two functional teams instead of waiting for the other to ask and respond back, thereby saving time and bureaucratic tangles. These interesting findings bring us the key question: How can other companies become a best in class performer? What do these benchmarks offer companies to shape up and drive sales and marketing together? Here are a few pointers: > Get marketing and sales to work together by making sales \"own\" the customer in terms of bringing customers views to marketing. This will make marketing to act on inputs that are on-ground, real time and owned by a colleague. This may not completely replace market research but someone within the organisation will start listening to the customer seriously. By doing this, marketing will have to bring in content that is in tune with what sales requires. This along with the shared templates, whitepapers, case studies, collaterals, etc can be very powerful in driving alignment between sales and marketing. More importantly, this will send the right message to all concerned for driving alignment. > Assign an individual or a team to have responsibility for marketing performance. Most successful, best-in-class companies do this and it has seen tremendous results. This has a high probability of making sales and marketing work together in sync. It is important for marketing to get its act right and this kind of responsibility assignment and monitoring is the first step in driving a good process of working closely with sales. Alignment is a result of such small but firm steps in an organisation. Companies that have average performance should immediately plan this as part of marketing operations in order to get the ball rolling in the right direction. > Once campaigns are done, make sure that the results are shared across all stakeholders, primarily with sales. More than just measuring and reporting to the CEO, it is more impactful for alignment to share the learning and best practices across stakeholders. This is what best -n-class firms do. Why does it help? It teaches the organisation what works and what does not, what needs improvement and what needs total destruction. Most critically, sales will have more sense of ownership and will support marketing leads to a pipeline. Once adopted, these three pointers will help improve the relationship between Sales and Marketing, ensuring that the two sides of the same coin indeed work best for the company.\n",

            "MUMBAI: The telecommunications department is pushing mobile phone operators likeandto make some upfront payment towards their balance adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, before being allowed to stagger the rest over several years, senior officials said.The move comes after both Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea told the department that they are not in a position to immediately pay any more statutory dues than what they have already paid, officials and industry executives said.The two sides - telcos and DoT - need to present a payment roadmap before the Supreme Court at its next hearing, which is scheduled on July 20.Vodafone Idea and Airtel still need to pay about Rs 51,400 crore and Rs 25,980 crore worth of balance AGR dues , respectively, having paid nearly Rs 6,854 crore and Rs 18,004 crore so far.The two operators have asked that they be allowed to stagger the balance payment over a maximum of 20 years, backing a government proposal. This proposal if accepted by the court is their last window of hope for some extra time to pay up their dues.\"Both the telcos have informed the DoT that they have paid what they could and are not in a position to add to the upfront payments,\" a government official told ET. \"They have raised issues with DoT's calculations as well.\"Vodafone Idea has even warned that it would shut shop unless allowed to pay in instalments.The dispute over statutory dues has been ongoing between telcos and the government for nearly 16 years. It culminated in an October 2019 Supreme Court order backing DoT and widening the definition of AGR to include non-core items.This left some 16 telcos - most of them either defunct or having exited India or merged with others - facing Rs 1.7 lakh crore by way of dues comprising of license fees, spectrum usage charge, interest and penalties to the government. Airtel and Vodafone Idea - being among the oldest operators - were the worst hit.DoTs latest stance is in line with the Supreme Courts observation in its previous hearing that the telcos need to make some upfront payment, to avail of a staggered payment mechanism.\"Although the telcos have also told the top court that they cant pay more, DoT wont take any chances and will need to show that they are doing their best to recover the dues,\" a second official told ET.In the previous hearings, a three-judge bench led by Justice Arun Mishra had slammed the department on several issues, including not making attempts to recover the AGR dues on time.The bench, also comprising Justices MR Shah and S Abdul Nazeer, had in June directed the telcos to file audited balance sheets of the past 10 years - after Vodafone Idea highlighted its stressed financials, and to come up with payment proposals, and asked the telecom department to consider them.As per DoTs calculations, Airtels dues are Rs 43,980 crore and Vodafone Idea's Rs 58,254 crore.The telcos had previously pleaded to the Supreme Court to grant them a 20-year timeline to pay their AGR dues without any additional bank guarantee or personal guarantees or upfront payments.\n",

A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine -- one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.

            "* Pre-dawn Israeli offensive is biggest in conflict so far * Militants fire rockets at Israeli towns for fifth day * Egypt leading diplomatic efforts to secure ceasefire (Adds Macron call, updated death toll in West Bank, protests in Jordan and Lebanon, bank building in Gaza) By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Stephen Farrell GAZA/JERUSALEM, May 14 (Reuters) - Israel pummelled Gaza with artillery fire and air strikes on Friday as it targeted Palestinian militant tunnels to try to stop persistent rocket attacks on Israeli towns. The 40-minute, pre-dawn offensive killed 13 Palestinians, including a mother and her three children whose bodies were pulled from the rubble of their home, health officials in Gaza said. The Israeli operation included 160 aircraft as well as tanks and artillery firing from outside the Gaza Strip, Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus said. Palestinian rocket barrages against southern Israel swiftly followed on the fifth day of the most serious fighting between Israel and Gaza militants since 2014. Egypt was leading international efforts to secure a ceasefire and ensure the conflict does not spread. Security sources said neither side appeared amenable so far but a Palestinian official said negotiations intensified on Friday. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, urging a return to peace in the region. the Islamist group that rules Gaza, launched the rocket attacks on Monday, in retaliation for Israeli police clashes with Palestinians near al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site, in East Jerusalem. Violence has since spread to cities where Jews and Israel's minority Arab community live side by side. There have also been clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli security forces in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where health officials said seven Palestinians were killed on Friday. At least 122 people have been killed since Monday in Gaza, including 31 children and 20 women, and 900 others wounded, Palestinian medical officials said. Among eight dead in Israel were a soldier patrolling the Gaza border, six Israeli civilians - including two children, an elderly woman and an Indian worker, Israeli authorities said. SYSTEM OF TUNNELS The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said there were reports of more than 200 housing units destroyed or severely damaged in Gaza and hundreds of people seeking shelter in schools in the north of the coastal enclave. Israel says it makes every effort to preserve civilian life, including warning in advance of attacks. we were targeting is an elaborate system of tunnels that spans underneath Gaza, mostly in the north but not limited to, and is a network that the operatives of Hamas use in order to move, in order to hide, for cover,\" Conricus told foreign reporters, adding that the network was known as \"the Metro\". Israeli warplanes bombed the houses of three senior Hamas military commanders in central Gaza on Friday that had already been evacuated, local residents said. An Israeli plane also bombed the building that housed the National Production Bank in Gaza City, with bricks and debris sent flying and windows shattered in some nearby buildings, witnesses said. Dozens of mourners took part in the funeral of six people - members of two families whose houses were hit by Israeli air strikes on Thursday - in the southern Gaza town of Rafah. Holding the cloth-bound body of his 19-month-old nephew in his arms, Khamees al-Rantissi said their house was bombed without prior warning. \"What was this child doing? What threat did he pose for the state of Israel?\" Rantissi asked. Netanyahu said on Thursday the campaign \"will take more time\". Israeli officials said Hamas must be dealt a strong deterring blow before any ceasefire. The Israeli military's build-up of forces on the Gaza border has raised speculation about a possible repeat of ground invasions during Israel-Gaza wars in 2014 and 2009, but Israel is loath to risk a sharp increase in military casualties. FLURRY OF DIPLOMACY Egypt was pushing for both sides to cease fire from midnight on Friday pending further negotiations, two Egyptian security sources said, with Cairo leaning on Hamas and others, including the United States, trying to reach an agreement with Israel. \"The talks have taken a real and serious path on Friday,\" a Palestinian official said. \"The mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations are stepping up their contacts with all sides in a bid to restore calm, but a deal hasn't yet been reached.\" The hostilities have fuelled tension between Israeli Jews and the country's 21% Arab minority. Violence continued in mixed communities overnight after street fighting and tit-for-tat attacks that prompted Israel's president to warn of civil war. Sheikh Ikrima Sabri, who led Friday prayers at al-Aqsa Mosque, decried the treatment of the mosque by Israeli forces. He said its \"sanctity has been violated several times during the holy month of Ramadan\" in what he called violations \"unprecedented\" since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Israel's military said a Palestinian tried to stab a soldier near the West Bank city of Ramallah. The soldier shot the attacker. Palestinian health officials said the man was killed. Major airlines have suspended flights to Israel and at least two owners of tankers delivering asked to divert from Ashkelon to the port of Haifa, farther north of Gaza, because of the conflict, shipping sources said on Friday. There were pro-Palestinian protests in Jordan and Lebanon, on the borders of the West Bank and Israel, and in Bangladesh, where thousands marched from Dhaka's national mosque. But the broader picture across the Middle East and the Islamic world, where Muslims are marking the Eid al-Fitr holiday and where restrictions on movement due to COVID-19 are in place in some countries, was noticeably muted. The U.N. Security Council will publicly discuss the worsening violence on Sunday, diplomats said after the United States had objected to a meeting on Friday. The Israeli military has put the number of militants killed in Israeli attacks at between 80 and 90. It said that so far, some 1,800 rockets have been fired at Israel, of which 430 fell short in Gaza or malfunctioned.

            "(Bloomberg) -- More than a third of U.S. workers changed employers or lost their jobs since the start of the pandemic, double the typical level in the previous two decades, according to a study. Among workers who had a job in February 2020, almost 37% were no longer with their employer a year later, according to a paper by Alexander Bick of Arizona State University and Adam Blandin of Virginia Commonwealth University. Almost 26% had a different employer, and the remaining 11% were out of a job. The historically high level of churn, or rate of change, underscores the colossal challenge of bringing back millions of people to the labor market as the economy reopens. Millions of workers who lost their jobs in the spring of 2020 were back at work in March this year, and the paper implies that the recovery is largely due to people finding new jobs, rather returning to their old employers. \"Shocks in the initial months of the pandemic may have permanently destroyed a large share of employer-worker matches, many of which may have been highly productive,\" the authors wrote. \"Because highly productive matches are costly to find, the economic disruption induced by Covid-19 may have induced persistent reductions in productivity and employment.\" For people who had been at their job for less than two years before the pandemic, the churn was much higher, according to the study. Almost 62% had separated from their workers a year later, versus about 16% for those who had been employed by the same firm for at least a decade. This could help explain the current labor shortage, especially in the restaurant, entertainment and hotel industries, which lost the most jobs during the pandemic and are now struggling to hire fast to meet brisk demand. Turnover is traditionally high in those sectors. All economic crises result in job losses. But the most striking difference during the pandemic is that a quarter of workers had a new employer a year after Covid-19 hit, said Bick and Blandin, who use a benchmark U.S. Census Bureau population dataset as the basis of an online survey to collect labor data in real-time. Thats almost twice as large as the next highest rate, about 13% in 1997. \"Generally, some amount of labor market churn is healthy because it indicates employers and workers alike feel confident they can find the right job and employee match,\" said Daniel Zhao, an economist at the employment site Glassdoor. \"However, churn is currently elevated due to the lingering hangover from the ongoing pandemic. Were nowhere near a recovered labor market where workers are quitting out of confidence rather than need.\" (c)2021 Bloomberg L.P.\n",

            "India's electricity use fell 6.2 per cent during the first half of May compared with the second half of April, government data showed, as coronavirus lockdowns imposed by states across the country stifled power demand Total daily average electricity supply to states fell to 3,666 billion units during the first sixteen days of May, compared with 3,910 billion units during the second half of April, data from federal grid regulator POSOCO showed.Industries and offices account for half the country's annual electricity consumption. Power generation in India generally starts rising from April and peaks in May due to a higher air-conditioning load.Power use in May has been higher than the same time the previous year except in two southern states and two northeastern states, the data showed, indicating curbs have been less strict than last year despite surging deaths due to the pandemic.India's federal government - which imposed a stringent national lockdown in April and May 2020 - has resisted imposing country-wide curbs during India's second wave, but most states have restricted movement.Senior government officials had cited the recovery in demand for power in late 2020 as a sign the economy was beginning to recover from its worst slump in decades.Three-fourths of the regions recorded a dip in power use in May compared with the second half of April due to curbs imposed to control the spread of the virus.Power use rose in the northern states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Delhi - among the regions worst affected by the coronavirus, even as overall power generation fell 6.3 per cent compared with the second half of April.Power supplied to Maharashtra , Tamil Nadu and Gujarat - India's richest and most industrial states which together account for nearly a third of the total electricity consumption - fell by over 5 per cent each.\n",

            "By Aditya Raghunath Investing.com -- A survey by rating agency Care Ratings said it is likely that Indias GDP growth for FY22 is going to be below 9%. The severe second wave of the pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns and restrictions in several states are slowing down the pace of economic activity. \"The economic recovery is beginning to lose steam with infection rates scaling record highs. Almost seven out of 10 respondents expect GDP (growth) to be below 9% for FY22,\" it said. A majority of respondents expect the lockdowns and movement restrictions, that hamper business activities, will stay in place until the end of May. Around 54% of the respondents believe that these lockdowns are the solution to curtail and control the second pandemic wave. Just over 75% of respondents feel that lockdowns during the second wave are not as strict as the ones imposed in 2020. Around 80% of respondents expect consumer demand for non-essential items to be severely impacted during the second wave of the lockdown. Data from Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) showed that 7.4 million people lost their jobs in April. The unemployment rate in April hit 8% compared to 6.5% in March.\n",

            "Gearing up forand Moderna vaccines that require ultra-low temperature storage, Indian companies such as Tata-owned Voltas and Godrej-owned Godrej Appliances are expanding their vaccination storage unit production and upgrading technology.Blue Star, another major player in cold chain manufacturing, is ramping up production of medical refrigeration units for Covaxin and Covishield, which will soon be supplied in larger quantities, as well as those units that can store the Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccines.The company said even Pfizer and Moderna jabs can be stored in its medical freezers, if transported along with dry ice and administered quickly.Voltas will launch its ultra-low temperature freezers required for storage of Pfizer and Modern jabs by August. Godrej Appliances has already developed such units for these vaccines and will start production once orders come in.Voltas MD Pradeep Bakshi said the company is in the process of importing ultra-low temperature deep freezers which can support storage up to minus 86 degrees Celsius. The company has tied up with an overseas partner for their production.\"We will be ready to cater to this requirement by the time these vaccines arrive in India around August,\" said Bakshi of Voltas.For currently available Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik V vaccines, Voltas is scaling up production of storage units. The government, currently presiding over a vaccine shortage in the middle of a savage second Covid-19 wave, recently set an availability target of 2.16 billion doses by August-December.Godrej Appliances is ready to start manufacturing vaccine storage units that can function at minus 80 degree Celsius as soon as orders are placed, said its business head Kamal Nandi. \"The product has been developed but we did not receive any order till now. But now we expect orders will come, with the government keen to get Pfizer and Moderna vaccines,\" he said.Kamal Nandi said Godrej currently has capacity to produce 30,000 units of this medical equipment per year and has roped in more suppliers so it can ramp up production. The market for the minus 80-degree units in India was, at best, 2,000 units per annum, used largely in research laboratories. Therefore, Indian manufacturers had no incentive to scale up manufacturing capability till recently.Blue Star managing director B Thiagarajan said the company has expanded production and is flooded with orders. He said a 1,000 sq ft cold room can store 1.44 lakh vaccine doses, while a 400-litre medical freezer can store 76,000 doses.\"India already has a reasonably good vaccine storage infrastructure due to its immunisation programme, which is being further beefed up. The real issue is no more about the cold chain availability, but rather the availability of shots,\" said Thiagarajan.\n",

            "By Geoffrey Smith Investing.com -- Crude oil prices rose on Monday as fresh economic data from around the world supported expectations of a sustained recovery in demand - despite jitters about the spread of a new variant of the Covid-19 virus. By 11:30 AM ET (1530 GMT), futures were up 1.0% at $66.03 a barrel, while futures were up 0.8% at $69.26 a barrel. Crude remains essentially rangebound between $65 and $70 a barrel, with the market having found a broad equilibrium as OPEC and its allies gradually open their taps in response to a global economic recovery. However, near-term gains have been made easier by signs of profit-taking from financial players last week. CFTC data released on Friday showed hedge funds and other money managers sold the equivalent of 31 million barrels in the six main futures and options contracts in the week to May 11. They had bought a cumulative 102 million barrels over the previous four weeks. Data published overnight, meanwhile, had shown Chinese refineries continuing to operate at an average daily throughput rate of over 14 million barrels a day, reassuring the market that the worlds second-biggest oil consumer remains in rude health - even if the year-on-year gains in industrial production are slowing. In Europe, meanwhile, the U.K. took its biggest step back toward economic normality by lifting or relaxing a broad swath of restrictions on business and social activity in England. The lifting of a ban on non-essential international travel is part of that package of measures, something that should help restore demand for jet fuel in a region where it is still depressed. The number of passengers using U.S. airports again hit a new post-pandemic high at the weekend, with 1.85 million people travelling on Sunday, according to the Transportation Security Administration. However, thats still around one-third below pre-pandemic levels. Globally, the level of flight movements remains even below that. A fresh indication of the difficulties in restoring international air travel came earlier on Monday when Hong Kong and Singapore again deferred the opening of an air corridor between their two cities, after the latter registered a new outbreak of Covid-19.\n",

            "Around 4.32 lakh railwaymen have been vaccinated so far and the railways is insisting that state governments inoculate the remaining, Railway Board Chairman Suneet Sharma said on Monday. His remarks came days after the government wrote to states instructing them to use their quota of free vaccines only for those designated as frontline workers by the government or those above the age of 45 years.The government's list of frontline workers does not include railway staffers, something that the unions have been complaining about for a long time.As reported by on Saturday, the letter from the Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Affairs instructed states to adhere to the government's list of frontline workers or procure their own vaccines for shots for any additional categories announced by them.\"The railways have so far vaccinated 4.32 lakh employees. We have been in touch with state governments for vaccination for the balance staff. The first stage was 45 years and above and the frontline workers like medical staff and RPF. They have been completed,\" Sharma said while addressing a press briefing.He said that now the thrust is on those aged between 18 to 45 years.\"We are in touch with the states, number one, to finish the 45 years and above group of people, now, not many are left. Secondly, to quickly cover our 18-45 age group in different states.\"We are in touch with the states, as the railways carries essential commodities, we run the Oxygen Expresses and meet the coaching requirements of passengers. We have been insisting on state governments to quickly take action in inoculating our people,\" Sharma saidHe also said that while the railways is yet to receive a formal demand for vaccination from any of its sectors, it is in discussion with railwaymen on the issue and have assured them that they will get them vaccinated the \"fastest\".\"More than 100 vaccination centres are there in the railways. We have increased our number of beds. Till last year, we had 2,539 COVID beds, now 6,972 beds. We had 253 isolation beds, now we have 573. We have four oxygen plants and 50 others have been sanctioned by divisions and zones.\"Earlier, we had 63 ventilators which have been increased to 296. We have added oxygen concentrators and medicines,\" he said.The Railway Ministry spokesperson also said that the railways cannot decide who should be designated as frontline workers as it is the decision of a specially formed body within the government.Currently, the definition of frontline workers include personnel from state and central police organisation, armed forces, home guards, prison staff, disaster management volunteers, civil defence organisation, municipal workers and revenue officials engaged in surveillance and containment activities.The All India Station Masters' Association has given an ultimatum of June 30 to the government to vaccinate them and other \"frontline\" railway employees involved in train operations in a letter to the Union Health secretary. It has said that if the government fails to do so, the non-vaccinated staff will have no option other than abstaining from duty.As of now, almost 2,000 rail employees have lost their lives to coronavirus and around 1,000 are infected daily.\n",

Initial claims in regular state programs fell by 34,000 to in the week ended May 8, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 490,000 claims. The prior weeks figure was revised up to 507,000. The labor market continues to improve as more Americans get vaccinated and consumer demand picks up, helping spur economic activity. As more businesses and states lift remaining pandemic restrictions, hiring is expected to continue to accelerate. Claims data have been volatile during the pandemic amid backlogs, fraud and new programs. Also, several states including South Carolina and Montana have recently said they plan to pull out of federal unemployment benefit programs amid a debate about whether generous aid is playing a role in why businesses are having a hard time hiring workers.

            "By Geoffrey Smith Investing.com -- Elon Musk rattles cryptocurrencies - and stock futures - with a fresh blast against Bitcoin. AT&T (NYSE: ) and Discovery (NASDAQ: ) are on the verge of merging their media assets. Chinas economic rebound loses steam as the year-earlier weirdness passes out of its calculations, and England takes its biggest step back to economic normality - just as a new strain of Covid-19 arrives on its shores. Heres what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, May 17th. 1. Musk stirs trouble in Cryptoland Crypto assets sold off sharply across the board after Elon Musk hinted on Twitter that Tesla (NASDAQ: ) may sell some or all of its holdings. A subsequent tweet from Musk saying Bitcoin hasnt sold its Bitcoin and doesnt intend to did little to restore the spirits of most digital currencies. Musk reiterated his newly-developed distaste for Bitcoins environmental impact, notably the key role of coal played in the mining process. He also twisted the knife by tweeting that DogeCoin was in a better position to become a mainstream means of payment, saying it would \"win hands down\" if it adopts the kind of approach to faster processing that Bitcoins closed community refused some three years ago. By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), Bitcoin was down 7.3% at $45,389, having earlier touched a three-month low. However, all other major crypto assets were also down, including , which fell 4.3% to just over 50c. 2. Dreaming of a new streaming giant AT&T is on the verge of a deal to combine its WarnerMedia unit with Discovery, creating a new streaming giant with a market value of some $150 billion, according to various reports. WarnerMedia, which houses HBO, CNN and the Warner Brothers movie studio, accounts for nearly half of AT&Ts $230 billion. Discoverys market cap of $18 billion is largely accounted for by its successful ventures into streaming unscripted cooking and home refurbishment shows. Had it come a couple of months earlier, the deal would have generated a handsome payoff for Bill Hwangs Archegos Capital, which had placed a big and highly leveraged bet on Discovery. There were few details about how the deal would be structured, but the deal has the potential to unlock substantial value for AT&T shareholders, who have seen their returns crimped by the huge load generated by the merger of AT&T with TimeWarner in 2016. On the subject of unlocking value, another stock likely to be in focus later is JD.com (NASDAQ: ), whose logistics arm said it would aim to raise some $3.4 billion through an IPO in Hong Kong of a 10% stake. 3. Stocks set to open lower, unsettled by Crypto sell-off U.S. stock markets are set to open the week in cautious mode, against a backdrop of the selloff in crypto that may bode ill for other high-beta assets such as technology stocks. By 6:30 AM ET, were down 100 points, or 0.3%, while were down 0.3% and were down in parallel. Crypto aside, the emergence of a new and more highly transmissible strain of the Covid-19 virus in India has cast fresh doubt on the world economys path to reopening. Taiwan closed its borders to foreign arrivals overnight, while Singapore has closed its schools for most students. In the U.K., London mayor Sadiq Khan was quoted as saying that there were over 400 confirmed cases of the new strain in London alone. 4. Chinas rebound normalizes, housing boom continues Chinas rebound from Covid-19 is flattening out, data released during the Asian session showed. The year-on-year rate of industrial output growth slowed to 20% from 24.5% in April, in line with expectations, while retail sales growth slowed more sharply, to 17.7% from 34.2%. The numbers are a foretaste of what western data will look like as the extreme year-earlier bases pass out of headline calculations, although sustained high processing of by the countrys refineries suggest the short-term dynamic is not losing any meaningful amount of momentum. Chinas housing market also continues to froth, with urban house prices rising by the most in eight months in April. 5. England reopens, just in time for a new Covid-19 strain The U.K. took its biggest single step yet back to economic normality, with a significant relaxation of restrictions on business and social life in England. The indoor hospitality sector is once again open, albeit subject to capacity limits, while meetings of multiple households are now also possible. The ban on non-essential international travel has also been lifted, although the small number of countries on the U.K.s 'green list of destinations suggests the tourism season is set for a weak start. Ryanair (NASDAQ: ) earlier was unable to give formal guidance for its new fiscal year, after reporting its biggest ever annual loss through March. The reopening comes at a time when there are signs of the new Indian strain of the Covid-19 virus spreading in the community in the U.K.\n",

            "By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com - Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) shares fell 4% Monday as cryptos took a hammering on concerns governments and regulators would come down hard on them. Coinbase reported its March quarter earnings, its first since going public in April, Thursday. It did not provide any revenue guidance, not a very surprising event given the volatile nature of the crypto world. The crypto exchange earns most of its revenue through cryptocurrency transaction fees. Both ( ), the largest cryptocurrency, and Ethereum , a distant second, are trading 9% lower. Dogecoin , a recent favorite of crypto champion and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) CEO Elon Musk, is 5% lower. and were both down around 12%. Bitcoin slipped below another psychologically crucial mark of $44,000. It is now down by more than 44% from the $63,500 it touched just over a month ago. The crypto is also suffering from Musk's recent flip-flops who till last week was its biggest champion. He remains a fan of crypto but not so much of Bitcoin, which requires a lot of energy to mine new coins. The world of crypto and particularly that of Bitcoin has recently been mired in debates over its stability, energy consumption, and use by criminals. Recently, Colonial Pipeline, the largest energy pipeline in the U.S., shut down after a cyberattack by ransomware gang DarkSide.

            "State-owned NBCC and Suraksha group, which are in the race to acquire debt-laden Jaypee Infratech Ltd (JIL), will submit their revised bids by Tuesday.According to sources, a meeting of Committee of Creditors (CoC) is likely to be held on May 19 to discuss the bids submitted by both the parties under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). In the last meeting of the CoC held on Saturday, financial creditors, which includes representatives of lenders and homebuyers, discussed their bids and sought various clarifications. During the meeting, both NBCC and Suraksha were asked to make necessary changes and submit their revised bids.In this fourth round of bidding process, NBCC is offering up to 1,903 acre, while Surakasha group has proposed to give 2,651 acre to lenders. Suraksha group has earmarked 1,486 acre to dissenting lenders out of the total land parcels offered in the proposal.NBCC has provided an additional 377-acre land in case dissenting financial creditors are not satisfied with its original offer of 1,526 acre, taking its total offer to up to 1,903 acre. While Suraksha group will keep Yamuna Expressway, which connects Noida to Agra, with itself, the NBCC will transfer over 80 per cent of stake in the road projects to banks and financial institutions. Suraksha group has offered to complete the pending around 20,000 housing units in 42 months.It has proposed a line of credit of Rs 3,000 crore as working capital for construction of projects. Suraksha group has also given an undertaking that any shortfall to the dissenting creditors will be met by the company through pumping of more funds or assets. According to sources, a similar undertaking has been sought from NBCC as well. It is estimated that around Rs 6,000 crore will be required to complete all stalled projects. The receivables from customers against sales are estimated at around Rs 3500 crore, sources had said.Meanwhile, Wish Town Home buyers Welfare Society and Ashish Mohan Gupta, one of the petitioners in the court case in Supreme Court, have written to the Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) Anuj Jain, seeking to know whether the bids of NBCC and Suraksha are compliant to IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) and Supreme Court''s order. This is the fourth round of the bidding process in the matter of JIL bankruptcy case. In March this year, the Supreme Court remitted to the CoC the issue of approval of resolution plan for Jaypee Infratech Ltd (JIL), saying no new expression of interest would be entertained for taking over the firm and only NBCC and Suraksha Realty could file revised proposals. The apex court had also directed to extend the resolution process by 45 days, which has already lapsed.The JIL went into the insolvency process in August 2017 after the NCLT admitted an application by an IDBI Bank-led consortium. In the first round of insolvency proceeding, the Rs 7,350-crore bid of Lakshadweep, part of Suraksha Group, was rejected by lenders. The CoC had rejected the bids of Suraksha Realty and NBCC in the second round held in May-June 2019. The matter then reached the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and then the apex court.On November 6, 2019, the Supreme Court directed the completion of Jaypee Infratech's insolvency process within 90 days and ordered that the revised resolution plan to be invited only from NBCC and Suraksha Realty. In December 2019, the CoC comprising 13 banks and around 21,000 homebuyers, approved the resolution plan of NBCC with a 97.36 per cent vote in favour in the third round of the bidding process.Then, in March 2020, NBCC had got an approval from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to acquire Jaypee Infratech. Homebuyers'' claims amounting to Rs 13,364 crore and lenders'' claims worth Rs 9,783 crore were admitted last year. The order was, however, challenged in the appellate tribunal NCLAT and later in the Supreme Court, which has now ordered to call fresh bids from the same two contenders\n",

            "The biggest risk factor for the market to watch out for would be the deadly coronavirus The benchmark indices started the week on a strong note and gained nearly 2 percent on May 17, with Sensex gaining 848.18 points, or 1.74 percent, to end at 49,580.73 and the Nifty closing 245.40 points, or 1.7 percent, higher at 14,923.20. Among sectors, Nifty energy, bank, auto, metal and PSU bank indices rose 1-4 percent. BSE midcap and smallcap indices added 1.6 percent each. \"The markets have zoomed past a resistance block of 14,850 and this should keep the Nifty bullish. Strong support lies at 14,700 and the index would turn bearish if we break this level on a closing basis. If the Nifty can keep above 14,850, we can claim higher levels of 15,000 and then 15,200. If we break 14,700, the markets could fall further to 14,400,\" said Manish Hathiramani, Proprietary Index Trader and Technical Analyst, Deen Dayal Investments. Among individual stocks, a volume spike of more than 100 percent was seen in Balkrishna Industries, Federal Bank and Colgate Palmolive. A long buildup was seen in Balkrishna Industries and Trent, while a short buildup was seen in Escorts, Voltas and Cummins. Here is what experts say investors should do on May 18: Chandan Taparia, Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives, Motilal Oswal Financial Services The Nifty opened gap up above 14,750 and moved north throughout the session. It recouped losses of the last three sessions and closed near the days high with gains of around 250 points. Technically, it formed a healthy bullish candle on the daily scale and negated its formation of lower highs-lower lows of the last three trading sessions. It has to hold above 14,900 to witness an up move towards 15,050 then 15,150. On the downside, support exists at 14,700 and 14,600. On the options front, Maximum Put OI is at 14,000 followed by 13,500 strike, while maximum Call OI is at 15,000 followed by 14,800 strike. Call writing is seen at 15,300 and 15,400 strike with unwinding at 15,000, while Put writing is seen at 14,800 then 14,700 strike. Options data suggests a higher shift in wider trading range in between 14,600 and 15,200 zones. The Bank Nifty has to hold above 33,333 to witness an up move towards 34,000 and 34,250, while on the downside, support exists at 33,000 and 32,750. Mazhar Mohammad, Founder & Chief Market Strategist, Chartviewindia.in The Nifty50 appears to be on the verge of a breakout as it erased losses of the last three sessions on May 17. The larger trend, however, will remain sideways unless the Nifty registers a strong breakout above 15,000 on a closing basis. Moreover, the price action of the last 50 trading sessions evolved into some sort of descending channel with valid touch points. As the Nifty is trading close to the upper boundary of the channel, a close above 15,000 can facilitate a sustainable upmove with bigger targets. In between, the Nifty needs to sustain above 14,725 to retain a bullish stance as a lower close can again embolden the bears. Traders are advised to wait for a breakout above 15,000 before initiating long positions on the index. Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research, Kotak Securities On reports of a sharp decline in coronavirus cases in India, we saw a smart recovery in the market. The financial sector did extremely well and the Bank Nifty gained 1,000 points to close 4 percent higher. The markets rallied throughout the day and closed at the highest point of the day. If global markets remain supportive and domestic news flow is favourable, then we would see 15,000 or 15,050 at the opening on May 18. A weak opening at around 14,870-14,850 will be a buying opportunity. The focus should be on financials, auto and commodities stocks with a short-term view. Ashis Biswas, Head, Technical Research, CapitalVia Global Research The Nifty witnessed some decisive trends and an attempt to overcome the resistance level around 14,950. While sustaining above 14,950 is vital from a short-term perspective, the market has to stay above the level to move towards 15,100-15,200. Momentum indicators like RSI and MACD have to recover after staying neutral to bearish in recent times. Ajit Mishra, VP-Research, Religare Broking Ltd Markets started the week on a robust note, tracking favourable cues domestic and global cues. Upbeat global markets triggered a firm start, which got a boost from a decline in coronavirus cases. Markets are cheering early signs of virus peak and stability in the global markets. But, we feel, participants shouldnt read much into a single-day rise and wait for a decisive break above 15,000 in the Nifty. For that, the performance of the banking and financial pack will be keenly followed. Participants should continue with a positive yet cautious approach and focus on risk management.

            "According to experts, the supermarket chains need to relook their approach towards 'e-commerce or online deliveries. live bse live nse live Volume Todays L/H More x Grappling with low footfalls for more than a year now, supermarkets across the country are rejigging operations with a renewed focus on home deliveries. Future Retails hypermarket retail chain Big Bazaar had announced its two-hour delivery initiative last month in April. The company claims that it is already servicing about 55,000-60,000 orders in a day through various channels such as its app, website, and WhatsApp. \"We have seen a phenomenal response towards this initiative and aim to get about 35-40 percent business through home deliveries in the next six months,\" said Pawan Sarda, Group Chief Marketing Officer Digital, Marketing and E-commerce, Future Group. The company is offering home delivery service across its 284 stores in the country. Other supermarkets such as Avenue Supermarts-owned DMart, More Retail, too, have been pushing home deliveries as they witness a decline in footfalls due to COVID-induced curbs. DMart, over the last year, has expanded its e-commerce offering DMart Ready to four new locations besides the Mumbai Metropolitan Region -- Ahmedabad, Pune, Bangalore and Hyderabad. More Retail is looking at an omnichannel play and pushing deliveries through phone calls, WhatsApp, and beta testing an app at several locations in the country. Reliance Retail, too, through its hyperlocal grocery delivery platform JioMart is eyeing the home delivery space. The company runs hypermarket chains such as Reliance Fresh and Reliance Smart. The race to the customers doorstep The $3 billion e-grocery segment is at an interesting juncture as Reliance Retail pushes JioMart, while Tata Group, too, vies for the share of the pie through its majority stake in BigBasket. Walmart-owned Flipkart, (Flipkart Supermarket), Amazon (Amazon Fresh and Amazon Pantry), and Grofers are other players in the segment. Now, with supermarkets, too, entering the fray, the segment is bound to get fiercely competitive. However, BigBazaar, DMart, and other hypermarket chains have work cut out for them. Sample this, last year, according to BigBasket co-founder Hari Menon, the e-grocery platform was servicing 2.83 lakh orders a day. Grofers, co-founder Albinder Dhindsa announced last year, was clocking 1.9 lakh orders a day. With its 55,000-60,000 orders a day, BigBazaar has a long way to go. Analysts project that BigBasket currently has the highest, about 30-35 percent of the market share in the online grocery segment, followed by Grofers at 20-25% share, while Amazon commands a 20 percent share in it. JioMart and Flipkart both have only 5-6 percent share each in it, as per estimates. \"BigBasket has built customer loyalty over time and consumers are sure about the quality of their service and apt deliveries. Others will have to match up to this,\" said Sanjeev Kumar, Forecast Analyst, Forrester Research. However, supermarket chains such as DMart and Big Bazaar, Kumar said, have a considerable brand recall, which could work in their favour. To gain ground in this intensively competitive segment, however, the companies would have to invest significant capital and resources. \"The companies need to invest towards building logistics capabilities, inventory management software, and AI technologies,\" said Kumar. Though third-party logistics solutions providers can also be roped in, he added, it would mean an impact on their margins. According to experts, the supermarket chains also need to relook their approach towards 'e-commerce or online deliveries. \"Most of these chains have been trying to make us shop the way Americans do, but in India, deliveries have always been a part of grocery business at local kirana level, where the owner supplies several products to the customer over a phone call,\" says Harminder Sahni, founder and MD of management consulting firm Wazir Advisors. These companies need to think like an online company and allocate resources accordingly, he adds, instead of treating it just as another business avenue. Dwindling footfalls The move towards e-commerce is a need of the hour for supermarket chains, as they report a decline in footfalls at their stores due to localised lockdowns across the nation. Reliance Retail, while reporting its quarterly earnings informed that footfalls at its stores, which stood at 88 percent of the pre-Covid levels in the fourth quarter of FY21, dropped to 35-40 percent of the pre-COVID levels in April. DMart, too has been impacted. \"In general, more than 80 percent of our stores are operating for a significantly lower number of hours (not exceeding four hours per day) or are even shut for operations for one to two weeks or shut on weekends. These shutdowns are having an adverse and severe impact on our revenues,\" Avenue Supermarts shared while announcing its earnings for the quarter-ended March (Q4FY21). Modern trade, which includes supermarket chains, was on the verge of recovery in the January-March quarter, revealed Nielsens FMCG snapshot. As per the research agency, the channel witnessed over 15 percent contraction between the July-September quarter last year, which improved to 8.3 percent de-growth in the first quarter of the calendar year 2021. It contributed about 9 percent to overall FMCG sales in the country from January-March, 2021 as compared to 10.4 percent in the corresponding period last year. The new set of restrictions can further derail this growth unless the new omnichannel play comes to the rescue of supermarket chains.\n",

However, the monthly gain for March was revised up by a full percentage point to 10.7%., leaving aggregate spending roughly where economists expected it to be over the two months. fell 0.8% on the month, rather than rising 0.7% as expected. Here too, the March figure was revised upward to a gain of 9.0% from an initial estimate of 8.4%. The figures once again testified to idiosyncracies in consumer spending patterns as the economy emerges slowly and unevenly from the Covid-19 pandemic: sales at auto dealerships rose 3.1% on the month, corroborating the robust demand for cars that had also been evident in the sharp rise in prices for vehicles in April's inflation report earlier in the week. By contrast, sales of apparel fell 5.1% and sales at hobby and sporting stores fell 3.6% on the month, having surged in March. March's data had been skewed by the effect of stimulus checks arriving at households across the country which, coupled with the start of economic reopening, had resulted in an explosion in overall spending.\n",

            "The Nifty50 snapped its three-day losing streak and recouped all losses in a single session to close above 14,900 on May 17, backed by banks, metals and auto stocks as well as a drop in coronavirus infections. The index opened higher at 14,756.25 and extended gains to hit an intraday high of 14,938. The index settled at 14,923.20, up 245.40 points or 1.67 percent. The index formed a bullish candle on the daily charts as the closing was higher than opening levels. The index needs to close above 15,000 for a strong uptrend, say experts. Considering the larger trend is sideways, traders should wait for a breakout above 15,000 before initiating long positions, Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist - Technical Research & Trading Advisory at Chartviewindia told Moneycontrol. The Nifty50 appears to be on the verge of a breakout as it erased preceding three trading sessions of losses with a single bullish candle on May 17, he said. \"However, the larger trend continues to remain sideways unless Nifty registers a strong breakout above 15,000 levels on a closing basis,\" Mohammad said. The price action of the last 50 trading sessions evolved into some sort of descending channel with valid touch points. As the Nifty is trading close to the upper boundary of the channel, a close above 15,000 levels can facilitate a sustainable upmove with bigger targets, he said. India VIX fell 3.27 percent from 20.26 to 19.60, the lowest in 2021, which experts say is a positive sign for the market. If it sustains below the same, it could support bulls. On the options front, maximum Put open interest was seen at 14,000 followed by 13,500 strike, while maximum Call open interest was seen at 15,000 followed by 14,800 strike. Call writing was seen at 15,300 and 15,400 strike with unwinding at 15,000, while Put writing was seen at 14,800 then 14,700 strike. The data suggests a higher shift in the wider trading range of 14,600- 15,200 for the Nifty. The Bank Nifty opened gap up at 32,437.85 and moved above 33,500 to hit the day's high of 33,506.90. Bulls ruled the banking stocks and the index gave its highest daily close in the last 10 sessions. It surpassed its previous hurdles, set to cross a falling supply trend line and sustained at higher zones. It outperformed the broader market and closed 1,289.80 points, or 4.01 percent, higher at 33,459.30, forming a strong bullish candle. \"The Bank Nifty negated its formation of lower top-lower bottom of the last three sessions. Now it has to hold above 33,333 to witness an upmove towards 34,000 and 34,250 levels, while on the downside, support is seen at 33,000 and 32,750 levels,\" said Chandan Taparia, Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

            "(Bloomberg) -- Chinas economic activity moderated in April from its record expansion in the first quarter as retail sales missed forecasts. Industrial output rose 9.8% in April from a year earlier versus the median estimate for a 10% increase. Retail sales expanded 17.7% in the period, far slower than a projected 25% rise. Fixed-asset investment grew 19.9% in the first four months of the year, in line with forecasts. The unemployment rate was lower at 5.1%. While Chinas economy has stabilized at a firmer footing in April, its still challenged by the pandemic and an uneven recovery globally as well as a fragile basis for recovery at home, the NBS said in a statement. The nations top leaders recently described the recovery as \"unbalanced and unstable,\" pledging further efforts to drive a rebound in domestic demand. Sheng Laiyun, a vice head of the National Bureau of Statistics, said earlier this month theres still a gap between actual and potential growth, suggesting the recovery has still some way to go. \"We did see that retail sales continued to disappoint,\" Jian Chang, chief China economist at Barclays (LON: ) Plc told Bloomberg TV. Thats consistent with data over the Labor Day public holiday at the beginning of May, which indicated peoples willingness to travel has recovered to pre-Covid levels but actual spending was still lagging, she said. Manufacturing Investment Chinas stock benchmark CSI 300 Index extended gains to as much as 1.8%, with consumer discretionary and information technology sub-gauges leading the rally. Industrial production remained robust on the back of a recovery in global demand, with fiscal stimulus and faster vaccine rollouts in many places helping to keep export growth strong. Rising raw material prices was likely a constraint in some areas, as is the push to cut output in sectors like steel and coal to lower pollution. On a two-year average basis, which corrects for distortions from base effects, manufacturing investment was down 0.4% in the first four months of the year, while infrastructure investment was up 2.4% and property grew 8.4%. Retail sales growth on an average two-year basis softened to 4.3% in April from 6.3% in March, with the consumption of goods and catering services both turning weaker. A separate report from the NBS suggests the property market remains strong, with home prices rising at the fastest pace in eight months in April. Authorities have pledged a gradual scaling back of the monetary and fiscal stimulus pumped into the economy last year, with no sharp turn in policy. Recent data shows a notable slowdown in credit in April, suggesting the exit might be materializing at a faster-than-expected pace. The central bank injected medium-term cash into the financial system Monday to match the amount falling due, a move largely expected by analysts. In March, the Peoples Bank of China told banks to curtail loan growth in the coming months and keep it at roughly the same level as last year. The pace of local governments debt sales to finance infrastructure projects also slowed sharply in January to April compared to the same period in previous years, according to Bloomberg calculations.

            "On Monday US drug maker Eli Lilly said that it will issue voluntary licence to Hyderbad based, ending the legal battle that was brimming over compulsory license for the drug in less than a month. \"Natco will be collaborating with Lilly to further accelerate and expand the availability of baricitinib in India during this pandemic, improving the local treatment options available to positively impact the lives of people who are currently battling COVID-19 in India\", the company said in a statement. Adding that the company continues to engage in active dialogue with the regulatory authorities and government in India to deliver baricitinib donations through the humanitarian aid organization, Direct Relief and to donate Lillys anti-COVID-19 treatments, including Lillys neutralizing antibodies.Lily has issued voluntary licenses for Barcitinib to six Indian drug makers besides Natco, these include-, Dr Reddy's,, Torrent Pharma and MSN Labs. Barcitinib, in combination with Remdesivir , received emergency approval last year from the USFDA for treatment of hospitalized Covid19 patients who are not on ventilator. Barcitinib is normally used to treat arthiritis. India's drug regulator granted an emergency approval to the Lily and Natco pharma last week.Lily's was pushed to issue the VL to Natco after the government of India intervened in an attempt to put an end to the legal dispute over the drug. ET had reported on May 10 that multinational pharma companies such as Lily have resorting to giving VL to experimental covid drugs that might potentially help them stave of demands for compulsory license from activists and questions from courts.Hyderabad based Natco pharma and a couple of health activist groups had filed petitions in the Supreme Court in April this year asking it to direct the Indian government to issue CL under section 92 of the Indian Patent Act that allows this in order to expanding manufacturing of a critical drug during a national emergency.It is not clear that at what price Natco will be selling the drug now that it has received a VL. But in its applications to the Supreme Court Natco has said that as an applicant it \" it will be making its Baricitinib formulation available at a cost of INR 30.00 per tablet\". The company has said that the total cost for the treatment of 14 days usng the drug will be Rs 420.00 for a patient. It had appealed for the CL on the grounds that Lily's brand was costing Rs 42287, for a 14 day regimen.\"The Applicant has not sought for a stand-alone non- Covid-19 approval and instead has consciously limited its request to the DCGI for Covid-19 treatment alone following the EU Authorization granted by the USFDA\", said the petition from Natco. Natco's company spokesperson did not respond to a text by ET asking the company whether it still continues to sell the drug at the price it had mentioned to court.In early May, US drug maker MSD also issued voluntary licences to Indian drug makers ---Cipla, Sun, Emcure, Hetero and Dr Reddy's--- for its anti viral drug Molnupiravir. MSD said that it will provide licenses to these manufacturers to supply molnupiravir to India and more than 100 LMICs. \"MSD is also in discussions with the Medicines Patent Pool to explore the potential for additional licenses\", the company said in a statement.\n",

            "From augmenting the oxygen production and supply to establishing Covid care facilities across the country, the oil and steel industry has been helping out in the war against Covid. As per a report by these two ministries, they together account for producing and supplying around 6,650 MT of medical oxygen out of the daily allocation of 10,000 MT in India. In addition, the 13 oil PSUs are establishing more than 100 oxygen generation plants at different hospitals across the country.The information was shared by Dharmendra Pradhan, union minister for steel and petroleum, in a series of social media posts.\"Under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi ji, the steel and petroleum industry have rallied together and are making every effort to help India combat the second wave of the Covid19 pandemic better and stronger,\" Pradhan wrote.With demand for medical oxygen growing every day, the public and private sector steel plants have ramped up their daily production capacities. The production was 538 MT per day on April 1 which has now been increased to 4,278 MT on May 12. The steel plants also have a storage of 25,000 MT of oxygen currently which is supplied to states as per demand.The oil PSUs are playing a major role in offering logistical support in carrying the oxygen to different states. The PSUs have contracted 207 ISO tankers with a capacity of 4214 MT to augment the last mile deliveries of oxygen. These companies have also placed orders for high-capacity oxygen compressors for filling oxygen cylinders. Currently, all these tankers are being used to supply oxygen to 12 states.Petroleum PSUs have also tied up with Singapore and Gulf countries to import 13,740 MT of liquid oxygen. Work is also going on to establish captive oxygen generation plants at 93 locations across the country by oil companies.Pradhan said ONGC is procuring one lakh oxygen concentrators. The company has already placed orders for 52,000 concentrators and 4,800 concentrators have reached.Apart from oxygen supply, these companies are playing a big role in setting up more than 10,000 hospital beds across the country. Pradhan on Sunday was in Panipat to launch a 500-bed covid care hospital which has been set up with the help of IOCL. Similar facilities have come up in Bina, Madhya Pradesh (1,000 beds), Kochi (1,000 beds), Chennai (200 beds) and Bathinda (100 beds) with the help of oil PSUs.\n",

            "Edible saw a strong increase of 8.5 percent MoM in April, shows data Health foods, branded rice and cooking oils along with immunity-boosting products were the bright spots in retail sales in April when pandemic-triggered restrictions across the country hit sales of fast-moving consumer goods. Recent data from retail intelligence platform Bizom shows FMCG sales fell 16 percent month-on-month (MoM) in April. The decline was led by a 12 percent fall at kirana stores and 4 percent reduction in stocking, as per the data from Bizom. However, sales of some categories such as branded edible oil and rice (non-basmati) were much better than confectionaries, which declined 20 percent MoM. Commodities and healthy foods gain, yet again Sale of most commodities except for edible oil and rice was impacted in April because of reduced out-of-home consumption of foods and the impact on hotels, restaurants, and cafes, but branded rice and edible oil fared well due to higher at-home consumption, said Akshay D'souza, chief marketing officer, Bizom. \"The overall commodity market grew slightly in lower single digits. Among these, edible saw a strong increase of 8.5 percent MoM, which indicates that people are stocking up these products due to restricted movement,\" he said. \"Branded rice (non-Basmati) also witnessed a 3.6 percent MoM increase in sales,\" he added. Healthy foods are also faring well. Marico has seen significant growth in its healthy foods portfolio in the January-March quarter, which grew 134 percent in value terms in Q4 and crossed Rs 300 crore in turnover in FY21. This growth trajectory, the company claims, continues. \"We have seen an exponential rise in our immunity-boosting range during the last month. Our brands such as the Saffola Immuniveda range of Golden Turmeric Milk Mix and Kadha Mix are showing an upward trend of above 100 percent growth at the start of this month as compared to April,\" shared Sanjay Mishra, COO, India Sales and CEO, New Business, Marico. According to Mishra, these products had an unprecedented demand on e-commerce, which has more than doubled its business at the beginning of this month as compared to March. Snacking on decline Unlike last year, confectionaries have struggled. According to data from Bizom, sale of confectionaries declined by 20 percent MoM in April. \"Last year, after the reopening of the economy, confectionaries had seen growth but we did not see this trend repeating itself in April,\" said Dsouza. Brands operating in the segment also have experienced a drop in demand. \"The overall sales have gone down across categories because of the coronavirus pandemic and its subsequent lockdowns,\" said Manish Aggarwal, Director, Bikano, Bikanervala Foods. Lockdowns and strict curfews in many states impacted delivery and distribution services, prompting the company to focus on finding and plugging the gaps in distribution, he said.\n",

            "By Barani Krishnan Investing.com - Gold displayed renewed fire on Monday to scale a more than three-month high that gave longs in the market optimism that a return to $1,900 might be possible after all. \"Gold prices are rising and up against massive resistance,\" Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, said as both futures and spot price came within striking distance of $1,870, a level last seen on Feb. 1. \"Bullish momentum could kickstart a bigger rally towards the $1,900 level.\" on New Yorks Comex settled at $1,867.60, up $29.50, or 1.6%. The session peak was $1,869.25. The of gold, reflective of real-time trades in bullion, was at $1,866.62 by 2:35 PM ET (18:35 GMT) after an intraday high at $1,868.51. Traders and fund managers sometimes decide on the direction for gold by looking at the spot price -- which reflects bullion for prompt delivery -- instead of futures. Golds breakout began Sunday evening in New York as the Asian session for the new week went into play. Even prior to that, longs in the yellow metal had an interesting couple of weeks amid arguments about runaway U.S. inflation after a raft of upbeat data on and prices, and . The Federal Reserve acknowledges that there are price pressures arising from bottlenecks in U.S. supply chains struggling to cope with demand in an economy reopening after months of pandemic-suppression. But the central bank insists that these inflationary pressures are \"transitory\" and will fade as the economy makes a full recovery from the pandemic. It also says it does not see the need for now to raise interest rates. Such an environment heightens golds natural role as an inflation hedge, say longs who are emboldened to attempt first a return to $1,900 levels last seen in January, before a further push to record highs of $2,000 set in August. Mondays breakout in gold came on the back of relatively-calm U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar that further enabled its upward momentum. Yields tied to the was up 0.3% at 1.64%. The , which pits the greenback against the and five other major currencies, was down 0.2% at 90.13. The relative heaviness with Treasury yields \"has done wonders for bullion and that trend should remain intact,\" Moya added. Investing.coms 3-year weekly chart for Comex gold shows the next plausible target at $1,945.70, which will be a peak not seen since the Jan. 6 intraday of $1,966.80. And if gold does not retreat meaningfully after that, it means that $2,000 could be on cue, precisely $2,101.60 -- which comes just slightly beneath the all-time futures high of $2,107.60 set on Aug 7.\n",

            "India has reported 26 potential cases of bleeding and clotting after administration of Covishield vaccine, a government panel investigating adverse events following COVID-19 immunisation has found.The Union Health Ministry said in a statement on Monday that over 23,000 adverse events have been reported since the vaccination drive involving Covishield and Covaxin vaccines started in the country and of these 700 cases were reported to be serious.The National Adverse Event Following Immunisation committee ( AEFI ) has completed an in-depth case review of 498 serious and severe events, of which 26 cases have been reported to be potential thromboembolic (formation of a clot in a blood vessel that might also break loose and carried by the blood stream to plug another vessel) events - following administration of Covishield vaccine - \"with a reporting rate of 0.61 cases/ million doses\".\"There were no potential thromboembolic events reported following administration of Covaxin vaccine,\" the ministry said.As alerts were raised in some countries on post-vaccination \"embolic and thrombotic events\" on March 11 particularly with AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine (Covishield), a decision was taken to conduct an urgent in-depth analysis of the adverse events (AE) in India in the light of global concerns, the ministry said.The National AEFI committee noted that as of April 3, 75,435,381 vaccine doses had been administered (Covishield - 68,650,819; Covaxin - 6,784,562).\"Of these, 65,944,106 were first doses and 9,491,275 second dose. Since the COVID-19 vaccination drive was initiated - more than 23,000 adverse events were reported through the CO-WIN platform reported from 684 of the 753 districts of the country.\"Of these, only 700 cases (@ 9.3 cases /million doses administered) were reported to be serious and severe in nature,\" the statement said.\"The AEFI data in India showed that there is a very miniscule but definitive risk of thromboembolic events. The reporting rate of these events in India is around 0.61/million doses, which is much lower than the 4 cases/million reported by UK's regulator Medical and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA). Germany has reported 10 events per million doses,\" the statement stated.Thromboembolic events keep occurring in general population as background and scientific literature suggests that this risk is almost 70 per cent less in persons of South and South East Asian descent in comparison to those from European descent.The ministry is separately issuing advisories to healthcare workers and vaccine beneficiaries to encourage people to be aware of suspected thromboembolic symptoms occurring within 20 days after receiving any COVID-19 vaccine (particularly Covishield) and report preferably to the health facility where vaccine was administered.The symptoms listed are breathlessness, pain in chest, pain in limbs/pain on pressing limbs or swelling in limbs (arm or calf), multiple, pinhead size red spots or bruising of skin in an area beyond the injection site, persistent abdominal pain with or without vomiting, seizures in the absence of previous history of seizures with or without vomiting, severe and persistent headache with or without vomiting (in the absence of previous history of migraine or chronic headache).The symptoms also include weakness or paralysis of limbs or any particular side or part of the body (including face), persistent vomiting without any obvious reason, blurred vision or pain in eyes or having double vision, change in mental status or having confusion or depressed level of consciousness or any other symptom or health condition which is of concern to the recipient or the family.The ministry said that Covishield continues to have a definite positive benefit risk profile with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths due to COVID-19 across the world and in India.Over 13.4 crore doses of Covishield vaccine have been administered as on 27 April in India.The ministry is continuously monitoring the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines and is promoting reporting of suspected adverse events.\n",

            "(Bloomberg) -- Chinese leaders meeting top U.S. officials in Alaska on Thursday will look for evidence that the Biden administration is prepared to take a softer tone toward Beijing despite tough talk in public. Theyre likely to be disappointed. Two months into his term, President Joe Biden is showing that for all his criticism of former President Donald Trump, his team wont make major changes to his predecessors hard-line approach to China. On human rights in Chinas Xinjiang region, on Hong Kongs eroding freedoms and even on tariffs, Trump-era policies remain in place. \"At least initially, theyre sticking with what Trump left them,\" said Aaron Frieberg, a professor of foreign policy at Princeton University and a national security aide under President George W. Bush. \"On concrete things like saying China is committing genocide in Xinjiang -- that was a land mine left for them on the way out the door -- instead of trying to work around it, they just embraced it.\" The meetings in Anchorage, Alaska on Thursday and Friday will bring U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan together with Yang Jiechi, a member of the Communist Partys Politburo, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The talks are expected to be contentious, a chance for both sides to lay out their disagreements in a relationship that has soured markedly in recent years. The encounter will also offer a case study for adversaries and allies alike: On key issues around the world, the Biden teams rhetoric has changed from the Trump era -- emphasizing cooperation with allies and concern for human rights -- but its actual policies arent that different. China is the most prominent example so far, but there are others: On Saudi Arabia, Biden held back from sanctioning Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman even as he went beyond Trump by publicly implicating him in the death of columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Biden is taking up Trumps push to reinvigorate the Quad alliance of the U.S., Australia, Japan and India. Blinken has praised Trumps \"Abraham Accords,\" the rapprochement between Israel and countries in the Middle East. And while Republicans in Congress accuse Biden of weakness, he is sticking to opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany, is refusing to remove sanctions on Iran unless it returns to compliance with the nuclear accord that Trump abandoned and is keeping up a frequent resort to financial sanctions as a tool to express disapproval. Middle-Class First The biggest continuity is the motivation for U.S. policy. Trump called it \"America First.\" For Biden and his advisers, its a foreign policy that responds to the needs of the American middle class. Gone is a vow to spread democracy around the world, or the idea of America as the worlds lone superpower. \"In the same way that Donald Trump came in and wanted people to believe he was making a dramatic departure from Barack Obama, there are elements of consistency and they dont necessarily want to admit to that,\" said Christopher Preble, co-director of the New American Engagement Initiative at the Atlantic Council. \"There is a recognition that if you dont at least gesture toward how U.S. foreign policy delivers benefits to the American people, then youre going to have a problem.\" Bidens supporters -- and Trumps critics -- argue that there have been several major departures: The U.S. has rejoined the World Health Organization and pledged more than $2 billion to a global coronavirus vaccination campaign. It has vowed to restore the Iran nuclear deal and rejoined the Paris climate accord, an area of potential cooperation with China. One legacy of the Alaska meeting would be if the U.S. and China schedule a virtual meeting next month between President Xi Jinping and Biden focusing on climate change. That could happen if the talks in Alaska are viewed as successful, according to people familiar with the situation. Bidens supporters also say its the \"how\" of foreign policy that hes doing differently. Biden has pledged to work with allies, rather than handing them ultimatums. So far, one of the biggest changes has been what Biden hasnt done: no more surprise tweets from the Oval Office, no more sudden swings or erratic decisions. Process is back. \"There will always be some form of continuity, but the change is in how to achieve your objectives,\" said Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a former U.S. ambassador to NATO. \"When it came to Russia or China policy, Trump had a different policy than the rest of his administration and those two were often in conflict and much of the administration spent their time trying to catch up.\" At the same time, the administration has made clear that for all its rhetoric, its going to stick to a pragmatic approach that will often disappoint human rights activists. In addition to keeping the Saudi kingdom as a crucial ally, officials have indicated they intend to maintain a partnership with Egypt, which has long been criticized for ignoring human rights. Theres another way Biden is like Trump: For all his talk about working more closely with allies, hes already shown a willingness to offend them at times. Canada, for example, was unhappy with Bidens decision to cancel permits for the Keystone XL pipeline soon after taking office. And many challenges are ahead. NATO allies still lag in defense spending. Japan and South Korea remain beset by tension. Turkey remains committed to Russias S-400 missile system. North Koreas Kim Jong Un is shunning U.S. entreaties to talk as he continues to expand his nuclear arsenal. \"Theyre still comfortably ensconced in the virtue of their superiority and havent yet had to face the tawdry discontinuities of their approach,\" said said Kori Schake, the director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. \"If it turns out other countries are no more willing to support American priorities under a Biden administration, then it has real-world consequences.\" (c)2021 Bloomberg L.P.\n",

The company has been accredited with ISO/IEC 17025 for the 'wet grip and coast by noise' tyre tests on the track, Apollo Tyres said in a statement.The testing capability is linked to the central government's plan to implement 'star rating' of tyres, in line with the tyre labelling regulation in Europe, it added.\"The new testing capabilities, developed by Apollo Tyres, show a very good level of accuracy and reliability, and the test results are well accepted by European Homologation authorities. This will enable the company to reduce time to market its products, along with the reduction in testing costs,\" its Chief Technology Officer Daniele Lorenzetti said.The major impediment to the government's plan of implementing star ratings has been the unavailability of adequate NABL accredited testing infrastructure in India.NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing & Calibration Laboratories) has now given the certificate of accreditation to Apollo Tyres Test Centre for C1, C2 and C3 categories of tyres, which are covered under the labelling programme.\"This facility will not only help us test the tyres for the Indian market, but also the ones that are exported, and need to meet the regulatory and labelling requirements,\" Apollo Tyres President- the Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa ( APMEA ) Satish Sharma said.\n",

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine -- one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show Dr Reddy's is currently scaling up the manufacturing of the drug. The company didn't specify the production volumes. On Monday Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Health and Family Welfare Minister, Dr. Harsh Vardhan jointly launched the new COVID drug 2-DG at DRDO Bhawan in Delhi. The anti-COVID-19 therapeutic application of the drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) has been developed by Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS), a lab of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), along with Dr Reddys Hyderabad. The first batch of the 2-DG sachets were handed over to Director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria and Lt Gen Sunil Kant of Armed Forces Medical Services(AFMS). The government said more will be handed over to different hospitals across the country for emergency use. The drug 2-DG, which comes in powdered form in a sachet, needs to be taken twice a day orally by dissolving in water. The drug is used as an adjunct therapy where it administered along with primary treatment. The clinical trials showed that the drug helps in relatively faster recovery of those who have been hospitalised and also reduces need for supplemental oxygen compared to those who are on standard of care.\n",

            "Brussels, May 17, 2021 -The European Union 's ambition to go carbon-neutral by 2050 means slicing greenhouse emissions from shipping by 90 percent as part of a far-reaching plan to shake up the maritime economy , the EU executive said Monday.\"We must change tack and develop a sustainable blue economy where environmental protection and economic activities go hand in hand,\" the European Commission's vice president in charge of the EU's Green Deal, Frans Timmermans, said.Maritime transport accounts for 2.5 percent of greenhouse gas emissions globally and 13 percent of emissions from the EU's transport sector, according to the Commission.A recovery in big economies from the coronavirus pandemic this year and next means seaborne freight -- handling 80 percent of the volume of the world's trade in goods -- is starting to expand rapidly.The European Commission hopes to counter the increase in emissions with a plan to encourage the EU's 27 member states and the bloc's neighbours to invest in sustainable solutions, such as more efficient propulsion systems, slow steaming and weather routing.By doing so, it hopes to grab the initiative from the UN's International Maritime Organization , whose own global plan along the same lines is perceived as too slow and inadequate to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\"We have an opportunity to start afresh, and we want to make sure that the recovery shifts the focus from mere exploitation to sustainability and resilience,\" said the EU's commissioner for maritime affairs, Virginijus Sinkevicius.The EU's approach covers also other \"blue economy\" sectors, including ports, fisheries, coastal tourism, and greatly increasing renewable ocean energy sources such as wind, waves and tides.Together, they all represent 4.5 million direct jobs in the EU and 650 billion euros ($789 billion) in revenue.Financing for the transition will come from the Commission and the European Investment Bank Group, which is made up of the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund.The EU executive said it also wants member states to use resilience and recovery funds, soon to be handed out.\n",

            "(Bloomberg) -- U.S. banks could cut as many as 200,000 jobs in the next decade as they try to boost efficiency to compete with fintech and other upstarts encroaching on their territory, according to Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) & Co. The eliminations are likely to accelerate as the economy reopens following the Covid-19 pandemic and conditions normalize, Wells Fargo analysts led by Mike Mayo said in a note, adding that \"this will be the biggest reduction in U.S. bank headcount in history.\" Banks have little choice but to improve productivity in the face of stiffening competition from fintech, technology and retail firms, he said. Non-banks offering lower-cost products online have steadily chipped away at the businesses of traditional lenders, with efforts intensifying over the past year as the pandemic pushed consumers to digital options. Earlier this year, Walmart (NYSE: ) Inc. lured a pair of senior Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ). bankers to run its fledgling fintech startup -- a move that struck fear on Wall Street. Mainstream lenders have pleaded with regulators to halt efforts by retailers and startups to offer core banking products. \"Technology is impacting banking more than even before,\" Mayo said in an interview. \"For banks, technology is both friend and foe.\" Goliath Winning The moves will ultimately improve productivity as banks become leaner with less layers of management, Mayo said. Thatll enable them to keep up with competitors, in a capital-for-labor swap that leads to 100,000 to 200,000 reductions over the decade. \"Goliath is winning,\" Mayo said. \"The largest banks have more scale to deploy greater amounts of technology to better serve customers while becoming more efficient.\" Branches will likely continue to close, with many shuttered by the pandemic unlikely to reopen. Employment per branch will also probably fall amid more self-service options, Mayo said. While the pandemic increased headcount by about 2% as banks took care of employees and pledged not to eliminate jobs, that short-term trend is likely to reverse, he said. Mayo said that the push for greater efficiency could end up forcing a smaller share of staff to shoulder more of the workload as the distance between the lowest-level employee and top executives shrinks. \"What youre seeing is flatter organizational structures with de-pyramiding, greater scope of responsibility and more expectations that each employee will generate either more revenues or greater efficiency,\" Mayo said.

            "By Aditya Raghunath Investing.com -- UKs Cairn Energy has filed a case against Air India, Indias national airline, to enforce a $1.2 billion arbitration award that it won in a tax dispute against India, according to a US District Court filing reviewed by Reuters. Cairn has said that Air India, which is completely owned by the Indian government, is \"legally indistinct from the state itself.\" \"The nominal distinction between India and Air India is illusory and serves only to aid India in improperly shielding its assets from creditors like (Cairn),\" the filing said. Cairn filed this suit on Friday in the US District Court for the Southern (NYSE: ) District of New York and claims that Air India is liable in case the Indian government is not willing to pay the $1.2 billion. This included the principal amount since 2014 and interest that has been compounding semi-annually. Media outlets have been reporting on how Cairn Energy has been sending out signals that it would go after Indias national assets on foreign lands. Investing.com had reported this in December 2020 and February 2021. In May, Investing.com had reported how senior public sector bank chiefs had been advised by the government that there is a possibility of Cairn attaching funds, and has asked banks to keep the government informed.\n",

            "May 14 (Reuters) - There is a \"small possibility\" that the remainder of the suspended Indian Premier League (IPL) season can be played in the United Kingdom or the Middle East later this year, Rajasthan Royals owner Manoj Badale said. The popular Twenty20 tournament was suspended indefinitely earlier this month after several personnel tested positive for COVID-19 amid a devastating second wave of novel coronavirus cases in the country. The pandemic also forced the BCCI to move the 2020 edition of the IPL to the United Arab Emirates where matches were held in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah between September and November. Badale said finding space on the calendar would be the biggest obstacle with India set to host the T20 World Cup in October. \"There is a possibility, a small possibility, that in September there might be something in the UK or possibly something in the Middle East either side of the T20 World Cup but it's going to be a real challenge,\" Badale told reporters. \"In my opinion, the players are already playing too much cricket. The calendars are incredibly packed, particularly this year after COVID. Boards from around the world are trying to get as many competitions and as many test matches as possible.\" Warwickshire, Surrey and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) have offered to host the IPL's remaining 31 matches in September. Sourav Ganguly, head of the Indian board, said earlier this week COVID-19 restrictions meant it was impossible to stage the remaining games in India where the number of infections have climbed above 24 million.\n",

            "The global steel industry is witnessing an unprecedented rally as steel prices continue to rise. A Motilal Oswal report says that regional hot-rolled coil (HRC) steel prices have continued to rise and was at Rs 66,750 per tonne at traders' markets on May but was still at a discount of Rs 15,300 per tonne in comparison to the landed cost of imports from Korea. As per a Credit Suisse report, China and FTA (free-trade agreement) export HRC prices rose $50 and $10 per tonne, respectively, in the previous week, while Indian mills saw hikes of up to $60 per tonne. Despite this, domestic steel prices are still at a 15 percent and 11 percent discount to China and FTA imports respectively. Considering that, there is still huge room for domestic prices to go up in the coming months. Also read: China iron ore, steel prices hit record as supply worries prompt speculative buying A big export opportunity Rising steel prices are a global phenomenon. The report says that prices in Europe rose by $20 per tonne to a record $1,185 per tonne, while Chinese domestic prices remained flat as of May 6, 2021. Spreads increased $32 per tonne, $121 per tonne, and $48 per tonne MoM in China, Europe, and India, respectively. China withdrawing from export markets in the medium term is also structurally positive for domestic steel producers. China is to reduce exports from May, as the country has imposed restrictions to support domestic industries. China's new export policy puts Indian steelmakers in a sweet spot as they are poised to benefit from the dual tailwinds. On one hand, steel prices are showing promise to increase further as they are still at a discount. On the other hand, restrictions on Chinese exports will open up markets in the US and Europe, where there are signs of an economic recovery. Domestic market hits a roadblock The steel sector is looking at a strong prospect of increasing exports but weakening domestic sentiments have emerged as a major concern. As per the Motilal Oswal report, India's steel consumption declined 26 percent month-on-month to 6.7 million tonnes in April 2021. It is likely to decrease further in May if the pandemic is not contained in time. Also read: Govt bans supply of oxygen to industries to meet demand from COVID-19 patients Due to weak demand, imports and production have also taken a hit. India steel imports declined 27 percent MoM to 364kt, while crude steel production declined 21 percent MoM to 8 million tonne in April. Amid this, low inventory levels, which are down 39 percent year-on-year to 8.3 million tonnes, remain a silver lining. Lack of oxygen supply has also hit steel production. Currently, the oxygen supply is diverted for medical purposes, leaving little room for industrial supply. As per the steel ministry, oxygen stock at steel plants has reduced to just half a day from 3 1/2  days earlier. Oxygen is crucial in various steel production processes like blast furnaces lancing and gas-cutting. Its shortage has badly hit steel production and the industry would be expecting the issue of supply shortage to be restored immediately to increase production and make the most of the rising international demand.

The company is in discussions with at least 2 states. About 15-20 percent of the initial supplies would be from imported from Russia. \"We have a supply committment of 36 million doses from RDIF in next two months,\" said M V Ramana, Executive Vice President and Head of the Branded Formulations at Dr. Reddy's.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine -- one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show The company said the price would remain the same for the government and private channels. The company said it would be working with hospitals in metroes that can handle -18 degrees Centigrade. The company is preparing working at 35 cities. Dr Reddy's as per its licensing agreement with can produce up to 250 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine, the deal allows to expand the volumes by mutual consent. Dr Reddy's also said it will be bringing single dose Sputnik Light vaccine in India soon.\n",

            "Inox Leisure | The Company has commenced the commercial operations of a Multiplex Cinema Theatre at Kolkata with effect from February 20, 2021 live bse live nse live Volume Todays L/H More x The second wave of COVID-19 in India is making many exhibitors lose hope because for cinemas situation is back to square one, said Alok Tandon, CEO, INOX Leisure's during Q4 FY2021 earnings call, adding that the quarter delivered a lot of hope. Once again theatres are shut due to coronavirus-led lockdown in different states. In a few places, where theatres are allowed to operate with limited capacity, there is no audience due to COVID-19 scare. This is why Tandon said that the first two quarters of FY22 will be a challenge. Challenge continues \"April-May-June is a write-off. July-August-September we will have to see. But starting October there will be string of movies which will be ready to release because by that time vaccination would be over. We have pinned our hopes on the vaccination of the entire country. I have got my second jab and have to be careful for 15-20 days. While I have to be responsible and wear mask, I may not be fearful of going out,\" Tandon told Moneycontrol. While Tandon hopes that after the vaccination drive the fear psychosis will come down and audience will be ready to go to theatres, things will restart for cinemas not before second half of FY22, according to experts. This means that like last year, two quarters for theatres will be a washout, putting more pressure on multiplexes like INOX. \"INOX is shut everywhere as 95 to 98 percent states have asked us to shut. It is only Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh with capacity restrictions. But there also we have shut down because there is nothing to show. There is fear psychosis. So, all our 648 screens are shut.\" With theatres once again facing challenging times, exhibitors like last year will have to think of measures to mitigate cost. One such measure is negotiations with landlords regarding rent waiver. Rent negotiations On this the INOX CEO said, \"(We are) still speaking with them. Some are ready for rent waiver. Others said that let this thing pass and we will discuss it. Developers are saying that we are standing with you.\" During the earnings call, Tandon had noted that expense towards rent and CAM during Q4 FY2020 was Rs 82.7 crore and this dropped to Rs 67.2 crore in Q4 FY21. For the current closures, Tandon said that in lot of places they have got a positive answer even for shutdowns which is voluntary. So, INOX's effort is to replicate the negotiations that happened in the last financial year. The multiplex operator is also deferring screen expansion plans and waiting for the situation to normalise. Expansion plans deferred For FY22, while INOX has plans to add 19-20 screens, to add more 25 screens it will be wait and watch. So, this financial year INOX will move up from 648 screens to 670-odd screens. The multiplex major is focusing on adding around 20 screens because 90 percent of the work is completed and for that it would need CAPEX of around Rs eight to Rs 10 crore. Ask Tandon whether there has been a drop in adding new screens due to COVID-19 impact, he said that there is no construction and we cant carry out our fit-outs because of lockdown. So, it is not the same at all. \"One of our best years was two years back when we had opened 85 screens in one year. Up till March 2021, we opened about 17 screens in five properties. And in this financial year we have opened five screens. So, it is not like we are not expanding only that it has deferred. It stopped because there were national lockdowns and there was no revenue coming in,\" said Tandon. Betting on content and food While challenges are plenty, Tandon is optimistic about theatre business. He said that there were about 20-25 movies in Hindi, English and other Indian languages ready to be released including big ventures like Akshay Kumar's Sooryavanshi, Shahid Kapoor-starrer Jersey, Ajay Devgn's Maidaan. Hence, content is there, he said. Along with content, INOX is betting big on its food and beverage (F&B) business. Tandon said that they want to increase the food segment's contribution which is at 22-25 percent to a higher contribution in the entire revenue pie of INOX. \"Apart from staple cinema food, we are increasing our reach and expanding it to meal options including pulao, dal makhni, rajma chawal. We also have special menu to satiate sweet tooth of our customers with jar based desserts like Tiramisu.\" Tandon said that today in megaplex in Malad, Mumbai, INOX is offering 250 items with 12 different cuisines. In addition, INOX has tied up with online food aggregators Swiggy and Zomato for better reach and especially to cater to non-cinema audience. For INOX, revenue coming from food business in 2020 was Rs 500 crore and Tandon said that they are putting a lot of efforts to increase this.\n",
